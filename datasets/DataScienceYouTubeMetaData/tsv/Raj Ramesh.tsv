Trust is always a big challenge with AI systems because we don’t often know how to interpret what is going on “in its head,” if you will. This is an active area of research, including the challenge of being able to explain how an AI system comes to the conclusion that it did. In this video, I simplify the concepts of trust so a business manager can understand how to look consider and build trusted AI within the context of their environment.

The world is getting more complex, and so are the global challenges facing us. The recent coronavirus spread is one example of a global challenge that escalated fast, and there are other potential ones such as water crisis and ecological disasters. The best way to tackle these challenges is for us to understand the true nature of the problem, the different components that are involved, and the roles of different stakeholders before we can build effective solutions. Business architects have traditionally addressed challenges within the enterprise by using some tools and techniques that follow a structure or template. But now we need to start looking outside the enterprise at the whole ecosystem, which might include the entire world so we can help those in positions of power and responsibility to direct resources effectively and make the right decisions. In this video, we use the coronavirus challenge to illustrate an approach for decision-making, based on principles of structured thinking. The intent is not to be comprehensive but to give you an idea of how one would even start to look at such challenges, but at the same time provide something of value. Many of these global challenges can benefit from using business architecture principles, tools and methodologies as a strong foundation to develop effective solutions. But the consumers of these solutions don't necessarily care about the discipline. With this in mind, we have simplified the terminology, so it becomes easy enough for a high school graduate level student to understand the thinking process and buys into the approach – which in this case is the COVID Perimeter Framework. ------------------ Here's what I can do to help you.

I want to share with you the high-level architecture of a real enterprise-class AI platform that I'm architecting. First, here's some context. My dad wanted me to become a doctor - a noble profession that helps saves lives. My interest, though, lay more in engineering. Little would I have imagined that one day, I'll be architecting a platform, build it out with the help of a fabulous team, and in the process positively impact the lives of not just a few, but potentially millions of people. It is with deep humility that I share this work with you. The company I'm working with is DataFoundry.ai. Our goal is to leverage both structured and unstructured data in the healthcare and life sciences space to get medicines to market faster! Today a lot of the processing is manual, slow, error-prone, and expensive. AI is a great technology that can automate many aspects of the end-to-end clinical trial process - from documents to automating tasks, making intelligent decisions, and getting smarter over time as the system learns. The AI platform is architected on a strong foundation that is secure, scalable, distributed, robust, and modular. With this foundation, we can bring drugs to market faster, meet stringent regulatory requirements, and even catch adverse drug reactions that happen even after the drug hits the market. Such a process would not have been possible without AI technologies. The flexible platform lets us build solutions that can adapt to future needs. Of course, development requires us to use methodologies like CICD, Agile, etc., and the use of AI/ML adds more complexity in terms of explain-ability, track and trace, model archiving, model updates, etc - things that I have discussed in my previous AI videos. ------------------ On a personal note, I speak, write, and consult on the topics of AI and architecture.

Today many businesses are trying to transform to adapt to the new realities of the world. Future business models are often dependent on available technology. For example, the Uber business model is made possible because of smartphones. Technology will be a major component of those future state of any business. One of the main technologies is artificial intelligence (AI) and businesses that master AI will establish themselves in a leading and competitive position. Many studies have indicated that the faster the business integrates AI, the faster it will move forward. This means that if you are late to the game, it is almost impossible to catch up. So the question to ask is how do you establish that lead?

Do you find that you often have to balance between standardizing your processes to make your organization very efficient and offering the best customer experience that's tailored to each customer? Well, then you're dealing with a phenomenon called polymorphism that is not often used as a term in the business language but might be useful to understand, especially for business architects.

Many organizations focus on designing and deploying AI systems to make the operations efficient, to improve customer satisfaction, to increase productivity, to growth, to introduce new products or functionality, among others. However, the global or organizational impacts of introducing AI is often done as an afterthought, which in turn results in a lot of chaos and patch work. In this video, I share one example of introducing AI into a hospital for decision making - and this is a simple example. Imagine the complexities when multiple systems have to talk to each other, data lineage has to be tracked, AI's decision making has to be explained, and the system behaviors have to be audited. Business architecture becomes to addressing this challenge because many dimensions of change have to be considered, while taking a holistic approach. www.topsigma.com www.linkedin.com/in/rajramesh	27	Education	PT5M14S	314	2d	hd	false		1	1036	43	0	0	10

While these are critical, if we don't communicate them well to our audiences, then the end result might be poor. So, communication and storytelling is a critical skill that we need to develop and learn. How do you tell craft compelling pieces? In this video, I share some of my experiences and what has worked for me. You might adapt some of these techniques but play to your strengths on what comes naturally to you to craft stories in your unique way.	27	Education	PT5M29S	329	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/357t2QLTVD4/maxresdefault.jpg	1	20911	489	29	0	32

When companies set up their machine learning environment, many do so with the intent of getting some quick wins to prove things out. Or perhaps managers got pressure from their higher-ups to do something quickly. "Every competitor seems to be jumping on the artificial intelligence / machine learning bandwagon, so we should do something as well, or we'll be left behind," is the driver sometimes. For individuals who are trying to learn AI/ML, it does not matter so much because we can switch environments easily. However, I'd caution companies to give it some serious thought. Companies should try to lower their 'technical debt' which I explain in this video.	27	Education	PT6M21S	381	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOiYsSNSm44/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1080	50	1	0	6

Almost every large consulting firm will come to you with a methodology and say that if you follow the steps of the methodology, you'd end up with a successful transformation. But if you look closely, these methodologies are mostly common sense. For example, we all know if you are are hungy, the methodology to solve that problem is: (1) find food, and, (2) eat. But you and I know that there's much more to it than that. Even with the most fancy methodologies, we have seen transformation after transformation fail. So what's the problem. Well, in this video you'll find out.	27	Education	PT5M21S	321	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/unh94S-edtY/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3758	104	0	0	13

Recently, Andrew Ng, one of the foremost Artificial Intelligence researchers who also built the AI teams at Google and Baidu said so in a Forbes interview. "AI technology is exciting, but it is also immature. At the risk of sounding sacrilegious, AI technology in isolation is not useful. It needs a lot of customization to figure out exactly how it fits into your business concept. Doing that requires a broad understanding of your company and a reasonably deep understanding of AI. Exploiting the value of AI today requires a team that understands the business context and has cross-functional knowledge of things like how to fit AI into your hospital or how to use AI in your logistics network. Without cross-functional knowledge of how your business runs, it is difficult to customize AI appropriately to drive specific business results." In this video, I build upon this basis and use an example to illustrate the need for AI and Architecture to be considered together.	28	Science & Technology	PT8M46S	526	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9DkD6NOsWvI/maxresdefault.jpg	1	7069	138	4	0	14

That’s not necessarily because companies want to rip you off, but the way they compute risk is approximate, and they want to err on the side of caution.

This is true for all kinds of insurance…. life, health, auto, shipping containers, valuable objects, etc. Machine Learning can help to estimate this risk better and therefore compute a more ‘fair’ premium.

A HBR study states that 80% of such mergers and acquisitions will fail. How can we ensure that these mergers are successful? In this video, we offer an option - use models. — script —— Last year has seen lot of mergers and acquisitions – around $2.4 trillion. To get an idea of how much money this is, if you stack up a $2.4 trillion in $100 bills, it will stretch from Washington DC to Denver! These M&As were to done for various reasons: (1) tax avoidance in the US, (2) crushing the competition, and (3) complementing capabilities to grow. Let’s talk more about the third reason. The merger itself is a business decision – but what needs to follow is a plan on the mechanics of how the merger will happen. Functional areas have to be merged, business processes merged, people reallocated, IT systems made to work with one another, and so on, all while preserving the combined company's competitive advantage and leveraging their respective strengths. This is tough. According to a HBR study, failure rate of mergers and acquisitions is about 80%. In 2008 Bank of America was forced to rescue Merrill Lynch for $44 billion, but that was painful at best, with long lasting implications, including the CEO of BOA at the time, Ken Lewis, losing his job. The cultural clash was one of the main problems. In 2004 Commere One, a high-flying internet company filed for bankruptcy after an acquisition failure. The company had many applications running on different platforms and technologies. Customers wanted to integrate across those applications. So Commerce One acquired a platform company. However integration with the platform was difficult to accomplish, leading to the company's demise. How you want to integrate the two businesses depends on your intent. To improve your current business’ effectiveness, you could dissolve the acquired company and fold its resources into the main business. Cisco’s folding of Webex for its technology in 2007 was a great success, while Chrysler’s acquisition of Daimler’s in 1998 was a colossal failure though both did similar things. Why? At the time of acquisition, Chrysler’s whole system was modular, and could reconfigured pretty quickly. Daimler’s system however we monolithic. Integrating the two was too difficult at multiple levels – people, process, technology and culture. Leaders needs to use models as a basis to understand the impacts and implications of mergers and how to design the new organization. Models can help to answer questions like.. - What are the areas of critical focus? - How do we retain competitive advantage? - How to scale? - How to identify the need for new capabilities? etc Models drive successful mergers and acquisitions.	27	Education	PT3M27S	207	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWNZa4s0vlU/maxresdefault.jpg	1	34358	205	12	0	11

Many times, projects in large companies are funded in isolation. This mode of funding is ineffective because it does not consider the enterprise implications. Sometimes a ‘low priority’ project may be the critical link in the achieving end-to-end customer value. So what do you do about it? This video explains…. Transcript: Typically, a company’s funding model is aligned to its organizational structure. For example, different functional areas – such as sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, etc. each gets a slice of the enterprise budget. Each area submits a list of projects, and the budget for those projects. The executives sit around a table and go through each areas projects and proposals, prioritizing them. Each project is considered in isolation. After some extended discussions, again all in isolation, the year’s budget is allocated to some of the projects. This causes huge problems which is not even noticed by the executives. There is no mechanism to understand the dependencies across. In one large telecommunications company, a huge marketing strategy project was approved. As the year progressed, this project was a great success – with many customers calling in to purchase the products being offered. However, since the corresponding product development project was shuttled, only a few customers could actually buy products advertised by marketing. This resulted in bad publicity and loss of business. What would have helped the executives make better funding decisions? A framework that enables them to look across all projects holistically and make funding decisions from an enterprise perspective. An overall corporate goal will drive the funding decisions instead of each project being evaluated in isolation. For this, dependencies across projects need to be identified. In this picture, the circle size indicates the funding required, and the colors indicate original priority. A project that may have been originally a low priority may become critical because it helps in achieving the overall corporate goal. Without knowing such dependency, the project may never have got funded. At one grocery chain, delivery of groceries to customers was designated to be important. Many areas were individually funded, but not enough money was allocated to the transportation area to be able to conduct repairs quickly since that was a low priority project when considered in isolation. This broke the “chain” and the company was not able to deliver groceries to its customers effectively. A simple framework can show cross dependencies. Of course, this can get fancier as we try to understand more about the projects, dependencies, and ownership. On your next funding cycle, build a framework that’ll help identify and talk through the dependencies across projects so funding decisions can be made from an enterprise perspective and not in isolation.	27	Education	PT3M2S	182	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3lyORd44fM/maxresdefault.jpg	1	634	13	0	0	0

In this short video, I share the need to use models for decision making - since the business domain is typically complex and managers often underestimate the complexity.	27	Education	PT2M45S	165	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XQFoi3Xdv-g/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1316	17	0	0	0

A neighbor whom I know for a few years invited us over to their house for a party, and in spirit of introducing me to her friends, asked the innocuous but dreadful question - “What exactly do you do?” At the time I mumbled an answer, not sure if my well-prepared elevator spiel made any sense. Her friends just nodded, just to be nice I’m sure, and probably had no clue on what I did. So I was incentivized to create this video that I hope explained what I do. The next time, I may just pull out my phone and show them when I’m asked the “So exactly what is it that you do you?” question.
