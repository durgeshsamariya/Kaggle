In this example, we will calculate the Relative Strength Index, the Simple Moving Average, and the Exponential Moving Average. Additionally, we will discuss the process of capturing arguments that are passed through by the users and then used that information to update our indicators as new rows of data are added to our StockFrame.

With the manifest file, we can specify how our add-in integrates into the Office Client. Additionally, we can specify different permissions, specify icons, and even modify the ribbon bar through this file. Now, it's very important we understand how the manifest file works and how changing it will impact our add-in as small changes can have very big impacts.

Now, to build an add-in we need to install a few different applications including Visual Studio Code, Node JS, Yeoman Generator, and create a new Office Add-In using yeoman. This video focuses on getting us set up with these applications and ensuring that we can create a new project that we begin to modify.

To say, that I manage the channel the same way as when I first started it couldn't be further from the truth. Some things I did were correct, other things not so much. As I got more familiar with YouTube and my viewers I began to realize that if I wanted to focus more on what I like doing, creating content, I needed to automate the management of my content. That way as my channel grew and I grew, the content could grow along with it. Well, this series is dedicated to sharing that journey and how I did it. In this series, I'll show you how I manage my YouTube Channel and the other platforms that I use to share that content using Python. Additionally, for those of you with your own channel, I'll share my experiences building a YouTube channel, the mistakes I made, the things I did right, and where I would like to take it.

Orders come in many different forms, each one designed to help handle a variety of situations. Now while, it's not possible to show you every possible order out there we can explore the main types of orders and the common structures they take on. Additionally, we will see how those common structures translate over to the TD API. Additionally, we will explore the importance of understanding how the entering or exiting the position and whether you're going long or short impacts the overall structure of the order.

Now that we know how to make the basic API calls we will move on to orders. Placing orders with the TD API is an in depth topic that will take a few videos to fully comprehend. In this video, we will focus on the operations we can perform on orders. The operations include, creating new orders, modifiying existing orders, and deleting exisiting orders.

The idea behind inheritance is I can use other classes as a template for new classes I create that way I don’t have to write everything from scratch. With inheritance we will see how it gives a natural way to provide structure and hierarchy to our program with minimal effort.

Well, I was inspired by a comment one day that asked the obvious question, "how would you do the reverse?" Well, in this video, we will see how to take an Outlook Table that exists in an email and export it to an Excel Workbook using VBA. Additionally, at this juncture we will focus on just doing a single table and move on to looping through multiple emails and exporting their tables as well.

After we explored the TD Ameritrade API, we noticed that some limitations came with it, for example, using a paper account and trading futures. In this series, we explore a new API that gives us access to the Interactive Brokers platform. With this API, we can do most of the same things we did in the TD Ameritrade API, but we get access to a paper account, and we get some new endpoints that will help us find opportunities. Video 1 focuses on the background of the API, understanding some of the context needed to get us ready to build the Python library, and we will walk through some of the installation steps required to get a bare-bones version up and running.

Custom functions allowed developers to integrate new functionality into Excel and extend existing functionality. Since custom functions were so popular in VBA, it makes sense that they were included in the Office API. In this video, we cover the topic of custom functions, the different categories of custom functions, and the requirements to build one for the API.

Well, sometimes the data we want is not necessarily in the format we would like, so we have to extract it. In this series, we talk about a particular document that contains a wealth of financial information and contextual information. This document is the XBRL document, which is a form of XML that is well structured and easy to parse.

With Power Query, we can aggregate data from different sources and mash them up into a single source. Most people aren’t aware that they can leverage these queries as workbook connections and even use them inside of their workbook using VBA. In this video, we focus on connection to queries using a connection object in the Excel VBA object model.

From VBA, we can also control and manipulate these same connection objects. The focus of this series is working with these connection objects, creating them, importing them and understanding their different components. The first connection object we will be working with is an OLEDB Connection that connects to an external Excel workbook. With this connection, we can pull in data from other workbooks and perform SQL queries that limit the data we pull in.

A service request is just a request for certain data from a specific endpoint. Like in the standard API, it would be nice if we could incorporate validation features to ensure that the service request being built is a valid one. Also, I don't know about you, but I hate remembering numbers and one thing about building a service request is to remember the number that maps to each field in that service request. For example, 1 could map to closing price. Let's make it more user-friendly and have the option of either passing through a field number or a field key.

While useful, it lacked one important feature, being able to stream data using the TD Streaming API. With the streaming API, we can connect a web socket to the TD Server and have a steady flow of data flow back to us. Additionally, we can access more endpoints some of which include Level 2 data. In this series, we take our API Client and extend its functionality so that it can create a new streaming client object, connect a web socket to the TD Server, log a user into the streaming service, help the process of building service requests, and being able to write the data to a file or database as it streams in.

The World of machine learning has been eagerly searching for ways to accurately forecast stock prices, and while some do exists their performance is hard to guarantee. In this series, we will cover a popular machine learning model, Random Forests. With Random Forests we will be a machine learning model that will predict the movement of a stock based on a range of indicators. In the first portion of the series, we provide a background of the problem an overview of the model and why it is used.

However, to generate the source code necessary, we need to understand all the objects that exist in the model along with their methods and properties. This is where the System.Reflection namespace comes into the picture. With this namespace, we will have a tool that will grab all the types of a given assembly and help us extract all the meaningful content we need to generate Python source code.

With pythonnet, we can access different “tools” that generally we would not have access to in Python. Some of these tools include generics, namespaces, and types. In this video, we will go over what these tools are and how to use them with simple examples.

The Pythonnet library is a remarkable tool that will allow us to plugin to .Net CLR. With this access, we can leverage built-in class libraries written in C# and different API libraries for Windows. However, one of the most powerful features of this library is it will give us the tools necessary to create our own Python Excel Object Library. The Excel Object Library will provide us with complete control of the Excel VBA object model and the ability to customize those objects to meet our different needs.

One feature our API Client has to have is being able to make requests to the API, so we need to incorporate this functionality using Python. In this video, we walk through a simple endpoint (get quotes) to demonstrate how our API Client sends that request. Additionally, we want to improve the experience of using the API, so we also discuss supporting functions that will complete tasks ranging from input validation to data preparation.

For example, our access token is only valid for 30 minutes! Do we expect a user to go through the process of getting a new access token every time it expires? I hope not! What we can do is handle that process for them behind the scenes while the API Client runs. However, we need to add some functionality that checks whether the access token is expired, functionality that will handle the process of getting a new access token using our refresh token, saving our new state after we get a new access token, and handling errors as they arise.

To start the authentication, workflow, we will first login to a new session with the client. From there, we will load the previous state from the last session and see if we can simply refresh our access token. If that can't be done because, for example, the refresh token is expired or this is the first time the user has logged in then we will prompt the user to do a full authentication workflow.

While these videos went into the inner workings of the API, they also exposed some challenges. Some of those challenges included making properly formatted requests, validating the input arguments, and handling the varying complexity in the type of requests made. All of this and more inspired me to make an API Client library that would make working with the API more comfortable, reduce some of the complexity related to making requests, and incorporate validation features to reduce errors from being made. In the first part of this series, we cover the overall context of the project, what influences impacted the way the code was written, an overview of the main functionality of the library and begin the process of handling authentication.

This required us creating a COM object, registering it with Windows, and then creating an instance of it inside of Excel User Defined function using VBA. However, we never explored the topic of array formulas or formulas that return a list of values. These types of formulas require a unique approach for them to work. In this video, we will cover how to build these types of formulas using the Win32COM library.

In a previous series, we explored some of the data repositories and how to scrape some of the filings. However, what if we need to do a more specific type of search? In those cases, we can use the EDGAR Search Tool to get back particular forms that meet a range of criteria. In this series, we explore how to use this tool from Python and then how to parse the results. This particular video focuses on building a request that we can send along to the search tool.

This creates a list that is circular and allows for easy traversal to previous nodes. In this video, we explore how to create a circular linked list and discuss insertion operations.

Additionally, since it's very likely we will want to save the data as it comes in we will also discuss how to set up a connection to a SQL database using PYODBC. From there, we will focus on building the queries to insert the data.

However, there are additional ways to collect data from TDAmeritrade, one of those ways is using their Streaming API. The Streaming API, while having some similar functionality to the regular API, will allow us to connect a web socket with their server. Once connected, this web socket will stream a steady feed of data from the services we subscribe to. In this video, we focus on building the authentication mechanism, reading the documentation, and set the stage for grabbing credential information.

This process of web scraping can be a time-consuming as it requires us to know the layout of the document and isolate the items. However, Python users have access to a robust library that makes the process of web scraping easy & quick. The name of this library is BeautifulSoup and in this video we will explore how to use this library.

This way we can leverage the power of Python with the flexibility of Excel and along with this add new capabilities to Excel that did not currently exist. In this video, we explore how to incorporate Python formulas into Excel by creating Python objects that we can run using VBA. This will allow us to call the methods that belong to these objects and pass through our arguments to them.
