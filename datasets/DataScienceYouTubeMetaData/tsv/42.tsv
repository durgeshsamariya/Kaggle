We are surrounded by objects all around us and if we have to represent these real-world entities in the programming paradigm we would need an object-oriented programming language. A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state. The class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. In this tutorial, we will be covering certain topics like How to define a class in Python, How to create an Object in Python, Constructors in Python, and much more along with the examples for better understanding.

Semantic segmentation is very crucial in self-driving cars and robotics because it is important for the models to understand the context in the environment in which they're operating. So far you have seen image classification, where the task of the network is to assign a label or class to an input image. However, suppose you want to know where an object is located in the image, the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case, you will want to segment the image, i.e., each pixel of the image is given a label. Thus, the task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars, and satellite imaging to name a few Semantic segmentation algorithms are super powerful and have many use cases, including self-driving cars — and in today’s video, we will be covering the certain application of Semantic Segmentation along with the Introduction to U-Net.

We present a solution intended to reduce the burden of the recruiter/employer involved in finding suitable candidates. The Resume Parser automatically segregates candidate information based on various fields and parameters like name, phone / mobile nos. etc. The huge volume of resumes is not a problem for this system and all the work is done automatically without any human intervention in identifying the top matching resumes for the given job description. The resume extraction process consists of two phases. In the first phase, a resume is segmented into blocks according to their information types (Text Segmentation - Contact, Education, and Experience). Here the named entity recognition is applied to extract candidate information from the resumes. In the second phase, Top N recommended resumes are provided to the recruiter/employer based on the job description. Problem Statement To design a model that can parse information from unstructured resumes and transform it into a structured format. The model shall recommend “top N” resumes from the extracted resumes to the employer/recruiter based on the job description. Parse information from a resume using natural language processing and recommendation systems. Stage I: Classifying a resume manually whether it is shortlisted for evaluation or not against a given job description Stage II: Training the model with the resumes against job description to classify whether it is selected or not Stage III: Recommend top N resumes from the above-selected candidates for the given job description The accuracy of the model could be calculated by comparing the results of stage 3 with the manual selection done on stage 1.

In this fast-growing world of ours, safety and security are of utmost concern. It has been very difficult to identify intruders that break into homes. Government agencies are now relying on artificial intelligence to solve this crisis and to improve the safety and security of people. Our intention is to prevent any such incidents and make use of AI to save people. Problem definition: At present, Government agencies rely completely on CCTV footage to capture the intruders, but this happens after the incident has already occurred. Another challenge is the fact that the CCTV footage may be blocked or erased by the intruder. In such scenarios, identifying the culprit is a big challenge. Using real-time CCTV cameras, we can capture the images of visitors approaching the boundaries of homes and then classify the person as known or unknown. If it’s an unknown person, the image will be sent to the homeowner through mail/SMS and the alarm within the house will be triggered.

On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially renamed the clinical condition COVID-19. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus Infected patients show common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. Patients with respiratory symptoms are advised to stay isolated and undergo further clinical examination RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). PCR testing is the medical standard to identify COVID-19. However, might take hours to receive results. With the growing number of cases walking into hospitals, alternatively, chest X-ray is used as initial element to review the clinical situation of a patient. If the X-ray shows any pathological findings, patients are admitted for further diagnosis. If the X-Ray is normal, patients are requested to go home and wait for PCR test results. The X-ray findings that strongly suspect of dealing with COVID-19 infection are the ground glass patterned area, which affects both lungs, in particular the lower lobes, and especially the posterior segments, with a fundamentally peripheral and subpleural distribution in initial stages. Radiology is playing a critical role to identify if a patient can go home to wait for test results (or) get admitted for further observation. One of the roadblocks using an X-ray is the availability of the radiology expert to interpret the image. Inspired by the AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology and to assist radiology experts to interpret images in a much faster rate & improved accuracy, proposing a deep learning system (Mask R-CNN) to analyze images and detect patterns of COVID-19 in patients. The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and as we see this is having a profound impact on the World. It is the most serious public health crisis and the most significant geopolitical event of the current generation. The need for continued access to research and learning has never been more important. Especially for India, which is the second highly populated country and is preparing for the worst. From one of the projections, it is stated that India might have to deal with 300 Million cases and of which 4-5 million could be severe. With an AI built CNN network, identifying individuals and assisting in time is a possibility. This in turn will have a greater impact on experts concentrating on severe cases to avoid further spread of the pandemic. With deep learning techniques, X-ray images can be more accurately and efficiently diagnose the disease by understanding the severity and type with the pattern.

Data Science is the bedrock on which artificial intelligence and machine learning are built, so such a foundational skill is certain to strengthen the employability of people proactive enough to learn these skills. There’s only one problem though – there aren’t enough qualified professionals. The fact that we have a skill shortage, and that the future will be built on the back of data will ensure that data science will be a very lucrative and rewarding career option for graduates. - To know more about Great Lakes and Great Learning's Data Science Program, please visit: http://bit.ly/dseprogram #CareerInDataScience #DataScience #GreatLearning About Great Learning: - Great Learning is an online and hybrid learning company that offers high-quality, impactful, and industry-relevant programs to working professionals like you.

People upload videos, take pictures on their cell phones, text friends, update their Facebook status, leave comments around the web, click on ads, and so forth. Machines, too, are generating and keeping more and more data. Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets. Spark-- A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time.

Spark-- A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost.

People upload videos, take pictures on their cell phones, text friends, update their Facebook status, leave comments around the web, click on ads, and so forth. Machines, too, are generating and keeping more and more data. Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets. Spark-- A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time.

The last 10 years, especially, have seen a sharp increase in the demand for highly skilled professionals in this area. But there are two anti-thetical problems faced by the industry - the lack of skilled talent and the shortage of quality learning programs. This week, we decided to take a deeper look into a program that solves both these problems at once. Ranked as the no. 1 Analytics program in India for 4 years in a row by the Analytics India Magazine, the 12-month Post Graduate Program in Business Analytics & Business Intelligence (BABI) by Great Learning addresses both the industry as well as the learners' problem in one go. On the occasion of 5th anniversary of PGP-BABI program, we decided to find out from the founders, faculty, students, and alumni about their journey so far. #GreatLearning #BusinessAnalytics #GreatLakes #BusinessAnalyticsCourse About Great Learning: - Great Learning is an online and hybrid learning company that offers high-quality, impactful, and industry-relevant programs to working professionals like you.

People upload videos, take pictures on their cell phones, text friends, update their Facebook status, leave comments around the web, click on ads, and so forth. Machines, too, are generating and keeping more and more data. Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets. Spark-- A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time.

People upload videos, take pictures on their cell phones, text friends, update their Facebook status, leave comments around the web, click on ads, and so forth. Machines, too, are generating and keeping more and more data. Existing tools were becoming inadequate to process such large data sets. Spark-- A new framework was proposed which is called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce(Hadoop). To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a very large dataset with sub-second response time. About the Speaker: Raghu Raman A V Raghu is a Big Data and AWS expert with over a decade of training and consulting experience in AWS, Apache Hadoop Ecosystem including Apache Spark. He has worked with global customers like IBM, Capgemini, HCL, Wipro to name a few as well as Bay Area startups in the US. #GreatLearning #BigData #SparkTutorial About Great Learning: - Great Learning is an online and hybrid learning company that offers high-quality, impactful, and industry-relevant programs to working professionals like you.

Access 100s of hours of similar high-quality FREE learning content at: http://greatlearningforlife.com PREREQUISITES: We assume no prior knowledge of data science, statistics or programming. This course is designed carefully to take you step by step from getting familiar with the interface, learning basic concepts to tackling more advanced topics. YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO: - Navigate the Tableau interface and perform basic operations - Import and connect to your data - Edit and save a data source - Understand Tableau terminology - Use the Tableau interface/paradigm to create powerful visualizations effectively - Create basic calculations including basic arithmetic calculations, custom aggregations and ratios, date math, and quick table calculations - Build dashboards and storyboards to share visualizations ------------------------------------------- WHY LEARN TABLEAU THROUGH THIS COURSE: - Step by Step Learning Path - Learn by Doing - Easy to follow and helps prepare for Tableau Certification - Concepts explained by solving real-life industry problems - Practical tips and tricks to save time - Taught by Industry Professionals and Tableau experts To install Tableau Public go to: http://public.tableau.com ----------------------------------------------------------------- WHY LEARN TABLEAU?: Some of you probably know exactly why you want to learn Tableau and want to get right into it. Others might still have a few questions. So, what is Tableau actually? How can it help you? How is it different from say Excel or Powerpoint? What will you actually be able to do after learning Tableau? All valid questions. A lack of data is no longer the problem. Data is everywhere. The real challenge is finding out what data is really important to your organization, being able to identify trends, causes, patterns, how to maximize your revenues or profit margins from data – so it is about being able to quickly extract actionable business insights from data. Whether you are a business intelligence analyst, a manager needing to create and analyse reports quickly or a data scientist you need to convey the great story that your data analysis is telling you. So how do you do that? Reams of numbers or pages of technical analysis won’t work – especially when your boss or higher management don’t have a background in data science or advanced statistics. What is scientifically proven is that the human brain understands large amounts of complex data best when it is presented visually – charts, graphs, plots these visual tools help to summarise and convey even the most complicated of your findings to others Sure you can do basic reports in Excel or you can make a PowerPoint presentation. But they are limited in what you can do. Or it is difficult and it will take you a lot of time and tinkering. ------------------------------------------- SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT TABLEAU? Easy to Learn Yet Powerful – even for non-technical folks: Tableau is a software program which helps you use a drag and drop, highly visual and easy to understand interface and tools to quickly create professional level compelling visual dashboards and stories of your data. It’s easy to learn, yet is extremely powerful. ----------------------------------------- #tableau #tableauTraining #dataviz #PowerBI #BigData #Analytics #BI #infographic About Great Learning: Great Learning is an online and hybrid learning company that offers high-quality, impactful, and industry-relevant programs to working professionals like you.
