With a simple trick, you can use it to get multiple match results from Non-Adjacent columns in a Simple & Dynamic way. You can also use this trick to get unique values from non-adjacent columns. So, let's say we have a dataset with 6 columns but we're only interested in the information in column 2 and 5, i.e. in non-adjacent columns. Plus, we don't want to get "all" value from these columns but instead only records that match a certain criteria. And we want it to be in a dynamic way so whenever we change the criteria, the result updates automatically. I'll show you an Excel trick that get's this done in record time. The secret is to broadcast array constants in our formula. And not only that: You can also use this to get a UNIQUE list of combinations that are in non-adjacent columns. As a bonus tip I'll show you how you can SORT the result based on a value that's not in the filtered end result. Many thanks to my student Adam Payne for sharing this method with me! *** In case you'd like to learn more about Excel Dynamic array functions check out my complete course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-dynamic-array-formulas ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-filter-trick-non-adjacent-columns LINK to FILTER video: https://youtu.be/Eehk6PC0oGs ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

In this video I'll show you how you can apply Conditional Formatting to show different colors for positive and negative deviations. This way you can quickly create an Excel bar chart with conditional formatting based on change % or based on any logic you choose. Comparison charts and bar graphs in Excel can be quite intimidating and force the reader to spend considerable time to make sense of them. Color can help to immediately grasp important patterns in the chart like good and bad performance. Research also shows that information that's color coded is easier understood and better retained in memory. For example if you use a column or bar chart to show deviations you can have a different color for negative values to positive values. You might choose to show the bars for negative values in red and positives values in green or any other color of your choice. I'll show you a technique how you can apply such conditional formatting to any type of chart in Excel. As a bonus tip I'll cover how to emphasize a particular part of a chart like the maximum value by defining a logic. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook at the bottom of the blog post here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-conditional-bar-charts Complete Excel Dashboard Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyz_4TwSfxzN_gsRtg3ODzyx Excel data visualization & advanced chart tricks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyyEj7oQkCf7TL9yQQWXbGOQ ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

Check the course landing page for more info. Stop wasting time creating complex formulas to transpose data in columns with multiple headers to get proper tabular data. With Excel's Power Query you can easily create a dynamic solution to transform your report-style data into a dataset you can use to run Pivot Tables on or do further analysis on with formulas. Unpivot means to create rows from columns. For example if you have a sales report and the months Jan - Dec are each reported in its own column. By Unpivoting we "shrink" this report with 12 columns for the months into a tabular format where all months are consolidated in one column and the data is shown in the rows. This way your data is properly structured for further analysis. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-advanced-unpivot-power-query LINK to Unpivot video: https://youtu.be/JMrfbv2h7p8 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

But writing nested Excel IF formulas in situations when more than 1 condition has to be checked can become cumbersome. If you have Excel 2019 or Microsoft 365 you can use the Excel IFS function instead. In this tutorial I'll show you how easy it is to use this logical function when testing for multiple criteria. Your formulas will be much easier to read. Since the IFS function only checks for the TRUE condition, how can you include an else condition in IFS? There is a simple way around this. Check it out at minute 02:42. I'll also show you how you can use conditional formatting in Excel (on emojis) to visualize results better. As a special bonus tip I'll cover how you could replace the Nested IF formulas with the VLOOKUP function. ⯆ Workbook is available here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-ifs-function/ (scroll to the bottom of the post) Link to Excel IF formula: https://youtu.be/KkTaQ5OjAGc Link to VLOOKUP video: https://youtu.be/hwL6KKJP-_I Link to XLOOKUP video: https://youtu.be/xnLvEhXWSas ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

Check the course landing page for more info. Discover the EASIEST way to perform text transformations in Excel. Power Query is the perfect tool for you to solve these tasks that can be quite complicated with just Excel formulas. Usually, solving these transformations in Excel are NOT an easy task. If you want to do any of the following with Excel formulas, things can get scary very fast: - Separate words in Excel by a delimiter - Split a column in Excel based on a certain logic in multiple columns - Separate text from numbers in a cell - Extract numbers from the middle of a text string - Extract text after a specific character in Excel But fortunately you have another option: Power Query aka Get and Transform. With this magic tool you can achieve this by just clicking a few buttons. And if this was not already enough there is another upside: Once you've setup the logic in Power Query, when new data comes in all you have to do is to click Refresh. And you're done! In this tutorial I'll show you how you can use Power Query to perform some common text transformation tasks. See for yourself how easy these tasks become with some basic Power Query understanding.

The go-to VLOOKUP formula does not work here because it just returns the first match! What if you wanted to use VLOOKUP but return ALL matches? You can do that now, with the new FILTER function available in Microsoft 365. But what if you don't have Excel 365? Is there an easy function that can return multiple match results? In this tutorial I'll show you a simple(er) approach that solves this challenge in 2 simple steps. It works in all versions of Excel and is quite easy to remember (at least easier than my original Aggregate version here: https://youtu.be/fDB1Ktyhp3Y). Many thanks to Bob Umlas for sending me this solution! In addition, I'll show you other options you can apply depending on your version of Excel: - If you have Microsoft 365 you can take advantage of the new FILTER function - In Excel 2019 you can use the TEXTJOIN function - For Excel 2010 and higher you can use the AGGREGATE function This way you have the COMPLETE guide for any situation on how to find multiple matches in your Excel data set. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here (scroll to the bottom of the post): https://www.xelplus.com/excel-multiple-match-results-complete LINK to original video: https://youtu.be/fDB1Ktyhp3Y FILTER: https://youtu.be/Eehk6PC0oGs TEXTJOIN & AGGREGATE: https://youtu.be/fDB1Ktyhp3Y ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

Check the course landing page for more info. Prepare to be amazed! This is the easiest way to combine multiple Excel files from a folder into one Workbook and create a table or a a pivot table report based on the consolidated data. Many of us send out templates to colleagues and are later faced with the challenge to somehow consolidate multiple Excel files. To append the data into a single Excel workbook can be quite a troublesome and lengthy process. Sure, a solution for this has always been Excel VBA. But learning VBA takes time and it can be too difficult for a lot Excel users. In this tutorial, I'll show you a much easier approach! We'll use Excel Get and Transform aka Power Query to combine data from multiple Excel workbooks. We will directly connect to a folder that contains the files and use the feature Combine Files in Power Query. Any time you drop an Excel file in that folder, the data will be appended and consolidated with the rest. You can then create one Excel table for the appended data or create a pivot table from the multiple Excel files. The best part about using Power Query to merge data from Excel files is that you don't need to write any code! You just need to click a few buttons to append the data from the files.

It's INTERACTIVE so the user can decide which TOP N records of a data-set they'd like to see. It will also NOT have a problem with showing MULTIPLE MATCH results either! This way you get to quickly rank the data and categories automatically and be able to show duplicate values with their correct categories. Instead of a complex formula with the LARGE function in a lookup-formula like INDEX & MATCH, VLOOKUP, or XLOOKUP we will use my new favorite Excel function: The FILTER function! Together with the SORT function we will create a simple formula to extract the data automatically. Both functions are available exclusively in Excel for Office 365 with the new Excel Dynamic Arrays features. We will even improve the report and make sure the user cannot input a number that's exceeding the available options in the data set. This will help avoid the #Spill error. To do that we'll use a combination of the COUNT formula and the SEQUENCE function. ★ Want to learn more about the NEW Excel?

In this video I'll share with you a simple technique to give your PowerPoint presentation a perfect flow to keep your audience engaged. 01:48 Use Roadmaps instead of a table of contents in your PowerPoint presentations Use Infographics to indicate the progress that was made in the presentation. This way the audience knows where the end is and which remaining topics they can expect to learn from you. 06:17 Put Essential text only on slide and use a supporting Infographic or Roadmap It's practical for you as the presenter to have everything you want to say on a slide. But the audience can't read the text on a crowded slide and listen to you at the same time. This will draw their attention away from you, the presenter. 07:28 Take advantage of the Reuse Slides Feature in PowerPoint Avoid copying and pasting slides if you want to use slides from an existing presentation. Instead apply Reuse Slides from the Home tab in PowerPoint. It's faster and safer!

(Ready, Enter, Point, Edit)	This Excel topic is not talked about often: Excel Cell Modes. Once you know which mode you're in: Ready, Enter, Point or Edit, it will be easier to decide whether to use the arrow keys or switch your mode first. This is the reason why Excel behaves differently when you're in a certain dialogue box. For example when you go to data validation and would like to adjust the formula, Excel adds a cell reference when you try to move around with the arrow keys. This is because of the Excel Mode you're in. You can see the active mode in the bottom left corner of your Excel spreadsheet. The normal cell mode is called Ready Mode. The moment you start to input something in a cell Excel will remove "ready" mode to Enter Mode. When we input a formula and start using the arrow keys Excel changes directly to Point Mode for formula selection. When you want to change an existing formula in a cell Excel will change to Edit Mode. In this mode the arrow keys can be used to move around inside the formula.

The solution was for a SINGLE row. But now we'll take this to the next level and replicate the searchable drop-down list (which is a simple Excel data validation list) to MULTIPLE Excel rows without VBA and without combo-boxes. We'll be using the new excel Dynamic array functions which are a part of Excel for Office 365. With these functions we can create a data validation list that suggests search results based on the user input. The match is made based on any part of the text - the beginning, middle or end. We'll use the the new FILTER function together with the SORT function. We'll combine these with legacy excel formulas like the SEARCH function (2:00) and the Transpose functions (8:30). As a bonus we'll also cover the XLOOKUP formula (10:40) ★ Link to complete Excel Dynamic Arrays Class: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-dynamic-array-formulas ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-searchable-drop-down-every-row Check out the complete Excel for Office 365 playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyyPFY31LldHWcJdLzGUPTSP ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

In this video I'll show you a solution that requires ONE single formula. This formula also excludes blank cells on the bottom of the data validation list. In our example the selection of a division will drive the available choices for an app in an Excel data validation list. We'll use the Excel OFFSET function and the MATCH function for the dependent drop down selection. This way you can have as many categories as you like. The challenge we have is that the number of choices inside the dependent drop down may vary depending on the division. I'll show you 2 solutions for this: Fixed number of Choices in the dependent drop-down (05:55) If you do not mind empty spaces (blank cells) at the bottom of the drop down you can fix the height argument in the OFFSET function to a specific (maximum) number of choices. Dynamic number of Choices in Drop-Down (07:15) If we want to restrict the number of visible cell values inside the dependent drop-down we can expand the formula to get rid of the blank cells on the bottom. This way we can eliminate empty spaces in the drop down selection. We will use another OFFSET formula inside a COUNTA formula to dynamically count the number of available choices. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-dependent-drop-down-every-row LINK to related OFFSET video: https://youtu.be/RPTQjbk2qy4 Complete Excel Data Validation Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKywYhC1Q9eZqR7D-_cdiwl6y ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

It's super easy with Excel dynamic arrays - specifically with the new Excel FILTER and SORTBY functions. This is especially useful for Excel dashboards to include interactive charts depending on a selection. The solution will be fully dynamic, i.e. we will not use manual filter or manual hiding. We will even take it another step further and automatically sort the Excel chart based on the visible sales data. To get that setup we will use Excel's new Dynamic Array functions exclusively available in Office 365. To summarize what you learn: 1. How to use Excel Dynamic Array referencing in charts 2. How to use Excel FILTER & SORTBY functions 3. How to Sort categories based on their values Step 1: Data Preparation Table (01:26) Whenever the chart has a different setup than the source data, a data preparation table is needed in between. We will use the new Excel FILTER function for that. In order to get the chart properly sorted we will apply the new Excel SORTBY function. This function is used when the sorting criteria is not in the result. The tricky part is to ensure that the array for the sorting (by_array1) has the same size and order as the array for the visible sales data. We will solve this by nesting another FILTER function in the formula. To get the respective sales data we'll use a simple VLOOKUP. Step 2: Excel Chart (06:30) For the visualization we'll use a column chart that's connected to the data preparation table. However, we want the Excel chart area to update automatically based on the number of data points in the data preparation table. In other words, we want the chart to be dynamic and to include any new selections from the data preparation table and exclude any blank areas. Excel Chart references can either take direct references or they can take names. Therefore, to keep the chart dynamic we'll use names in the Name Manager and we'll use the "#" for the reference to spill. Then we'll update the Series Values and the Axis Labels of the chart with the names we created. Step 3: Dynamic Dashboard (09:38) This technique can easily be used to create dynamic dashboards. Based on a dropdown selection the chart is automatically updated. I used the Excel IF and SUMPRODUCT functions to help with that. In order to make sure that new data is added to the chart I converted the data into an official Excel table. By combining the power of Excel tables and the new Excel Dynamic Arrays such dashboards can be created really fast. 00:00 Intro 01:26 Prepare Data Table 06:30 Create Excel Chart 09:38 Setup Dynamic Excel Dashboard ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-da-dynamic-sorted-chart LINKS to Excel Dynamic Arrays Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyyPFY31LldHWcJdLzGUPTSP Excel Dashboards & Reports Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyz_4TwSfxzN_gsRtg3ODzyx ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

But what do you do if that column includes blank cells and you'd like to highlight the entire column of data? CTRL + Shift + down arrow key will stop the moment it comes across a blank cell. Check out this video for the update: https://youtu.be/zo4l-G3Qgyk This is often a very annoying problem especially if it's a large data set or there are a lot of blank cells. In this video I'm going to show you a trick which EASILY gets this done. A shortcut which is often used is CTRL + End which jumps to the end of the data set. However, that may not always work if there is some additional input in other cells outside of the data set. Here's the Excel Keyboard Shortcut(s) to Select Column with Blank Cells: A better alternative is to use the Name Box in Excel. Just put in the range you want and use a random, very high "TO" value where you know you will not have any data anymore, e.g. B1:B10000. Press Enter. This will highlight the entire range. Then use the short cut CTRL + SHIFT + ⯅. This will highlight the data set including the blank cells. The same thing can also be done with just the keyboard, no mouse. Press CTRL + G to get to the Name Manager. In the reference field type in the range, e.g. B1:B10000 and press Enter. Then use the short cut CTRL + SHIFT + ⯅. This will highlight the data set including the blank cells.

My team and I, did an extensive search on this mysterious Excel formula syntax, but found no information about it. It's a super short formula in Excel to count cells with text and ignore blank cells, numbers and also formula cells that result in blank cells or empty strings. This is one of a kind Excel formula hack. I received this special syntax for the Excel COUNTIF function from Jack, one of our community members. It works perfectly although I have no idea why. Because it looks like we are applying a wrong Excel syntax (angry eyes). If we were to write the formula "correctly" it would only exclude the truly blank cells. But cells that include formulas which result in blank cells would still be included in the count. Alternatively, we can use the Excel COUNTIF function with the placeholders ? and *. This Excel count formula which uses wildcards, will also also just count non blank cells and ignore formulas that result in blank cells as well as ignore zeros and other numbers. In a situation when we want to count all cells that include either text or numbers we can use SUMPRODUCT in combination with the LEN function. This way we can check if the length of the content in the cells is at least 1 character. You can replace SUMPRODUCT with SUM if you have the new Dynamic Array Excel - if you have legacy Excel and use SUM instead of SUMPRODUCT you need to press Control+shift+enter. As a summary - In this Excel tutorial we take a look at different methods to Count in Excel: 1. Excel formula hack to count text cells: 2:07 2. Alternate Excel formula to count text cells (with wildcards): 2:52 3. Count all cells except the truly blank cells in Excel: 3:49 4.

You'll also need this for evaluating different options or choices of investments. We can calculate this "time value of money" easily in Excel. In fact in this video, I'll show you an Excel template you can use to calculate the time value of money for any investment decisions. Question: If a customer asks you if instead of paying $10,000 in cash now he could pay $10,800 over 4 years. Is that a good deal for you? The answer depends on several factors: 1. Opportunity Costs - Money has an earning capacity. So, instead of waiting for the money, you could invest it and hopefully make more out of it. By getting the money later, you lose the opportunity to make an additional income. 2. Inflation - Prices increase over time. So, the same item will probably cost more in a couple of years. 3. Risk - Payments in the future always carry a certain risk. Will you really get the money then? The combination of these factors defines the time value of money and is expressed as a discount rate. For instance a discount rate of 5% means that in each successive year the same amount of money is going to be worth 5% less than in the previous year. You'll learn how to calculate Present Value (PV) manually and then we'll use the Excel NPV formula to calculate the Net Present Value in one go. Input values is the discount rate and the future cash flows. In order to compare alternatives with different timing of payments we need to calculate their present value. In other words we need to discount future payments. Companies often use their Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which is their average cost to get equity and debt. By applying their WACC as discount rate, any project that results in a NPV greater than zero is worth doing. Key Takeaways: - The further in the future the payments are, the lower their present value will be - Think of the discount rate as a hurdle. The higher the hurdle, the more difficult it will be to get a high present value ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/time-value-of-money-excel-npv Advanced Excel Formulas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxvxehq3fiGjKDsEyy6d4Tz Finance & Accounting playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKywV8Bk6euT02xxtv8YVDkZs ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Not sure which of my Excel courses fits best for you?

The best part is it's dynamic because it's linked to cells. Organizational Charts (Org Charts) or Organigrams are used in companies to graphically show the internal structure of the organization. The employees are usually represented by boxes and the chart also shows the relation of the positions to another. This is a great way to visualize an organization. Very often these Org Charts are created by using Excel Smart Art or Excel Shapes. But this is not a dynamic solution. Every time anything changes, the chart has to be manually updated. This is very time consuming and error prone. In this video I'll show you an easier and dynamic alternative using Excel and a free Visio add-in from in Office 365 (no Visio subscription is required). With this, we can create automatically create an organization chart from employee data. The org Chart will be dynamic too, because it will be linked to cell values. The basis for the organizational chart is an Excel table containing the required information like departments, employee names, employee IDs, job titles, who the position is reporting to, and so on. The organization chart is created by using the Microsoft Visio Data Visualizer add-in which is a free tool in Office 365. After selecting the chart type in the Visio Data Visualizer it creates a draft org chart and a connected Excel data template. All we have to do is to bring over the actual organizational information into this data template. Then hit Refresh in the chart area and the organization chart is automatically updated. Every time there is a change in the organization just update the data table and hit Refresh. The changes will be automatically reflected in the chart. The tool even includes a data checker that will inform you about data inconsistencies like empty or duplicate cell information. In addition to organization charts the Visio Data Visualizer can also create different diagrams like Basic Flowcharts or Cross-Functional Flowcharts. This way, process steps and the required process flow can be visualized based on Excel data. The final Organizational Chart can easily be printed or saved as PDF. In the chart area just click on More Options and select Open in Web. From there you can directly send the chart to the printer or Download as PDF. Please note that in order to edit the appearance of the diagram in the Visio Data Visualizer you need to have an Office 365 subscription with a license for Visio. The Microsoft Visio team was very kind to provide an email address to contact if you run into issues with the add-in.

You'll learn how to calculate the numbers on your real estate investment to find out if the property is worth buying. Many thanks to Skillshare for Sponsoring this video and supporting my channel. Summary of what you learn: Learn how to analyze if a rental property is worth buying by calculating the Cash-On-Cash Return and the Return on Investment (ROI) of the rental property. We'll setup an Excel template, i.e, a rental property calculator which can also be adjusted for all kinds of investment decisions. Use this free Excel workbook to calculate the return on your investment so that your next investment will be a success. Focus on the numbers and make sure you plug in realistic assumptions! In this video we'll go through all the required steps to calculate the monthly rental property income by identifying all related revenue and expenses. We will also use the Excel PMT formula to quickly calculate the monthly debt service for the externally financed part of the investment. In a first step we'll calculate the Cash-On-Cash Return. This is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of annual before-tax Cash Flow divided by the equity or own money invested in the property. This figure is useful when consistent monthly cash flows are the most important consideration for the investment. But because it's based on cash flows it considers the full debt service. So, both the interest and the principal pay down are deducted from the rental revenue. But most investors do not consider the principal payment as an expense. Because by reducing the outstanding principal balance we create equity. Therefore, we'll also calculate the Return on Investment or RoI of the property. For this we'll exclude the principal pay down from the expenses. To do that we'll use the Excel formulas CUMIPMT and CUMPRINC to split the monthly annuity. The resulting cash flow we divide again by the equity invested in the property. ************************************************************ ⯆ DOWNLOAD the Excel workbook here (scroll to the bottom of the blog post): https://www.xelplus.com/rental-property-roi-calculator-excel More finance & accounting videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKywV8Bk6euT02xxtv8YVDkZs Excel advanced formulas: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxvxehq3fiGjKDsEyy6d4Tz ************************************************************ ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You'll come across extra spaces when you copy data from your email or import data from another system. Each cell value ends up having trailing or leading spaces. Sometimes they can be removed easily with the TRIM function but sometimes TRIM doesn't work! In this video I'll show you how you can TRIM ALL Spaces - also the stubborn ones.  TRIM can only remove spaces with an ASCII character code 32. But there is another character code that represents a space. It's commonly referred to as a Non-Breaking Space and its ASCII character code is 160. Such spaces commonly occur when we copy text from Outlook or a website to Excel. With the Excel function CODE() we can identify which character code we are dealing with. To remove a non-breaking space in Excel we can use the SUBSTITUTE function. With this function we can look for character code 160 in a cell and replace it with a regular space. For numbers that are not recognized as numbers by Excel we can use the VALUE function. If the number contains non-breaking spaces use it in combination with the SUBSTITUTE function. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-trim-all-spaces Check out other Excel tips and tricks in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxVeel8DFjewBSlZYdfd38A ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

It will show you how effective a business is in managing its cash. Most companies apply Accrual Accounting and it's important to understand that under this method revenue does not always equal cash in, and incurred expenses do not equal cash out. Therefore, don't make the mistake to just look at the income statement and the balance sheet. Focus on the Cash Flow Statement as well because it will show you where the company makes and spends its money. The Cash Flow Statement consists of 3 main parts: Cash Flow from Operations Here we can find out how much cash a business is able to generate by selling its products and services. To calculate the Cash Flow from Operations there are 2 methods in use. In this video we will focus on the indirect method because it's used by most companies. It's linked to the income statement and starts with the Net Income. But in Accrual Accounting revenue does not equal cash in, and expenses do not equal cash out. Therefore, the net income from the Income statement must be adjusted to see the actual cash flows. The most common adjustments are for non-cash transactions (depreciation, amortization, gains/losses for sales of non-current assets), and for working capital. Cash Flow from Investing Activities This shows the cash spent on investments or cash received from sales of investments. Here we can see the full cash inflow or outflow when a company purchases or sells property, equipment or other investments. We can also find out if the business acquired a company to expand its activities. Cash Flow from Financing Activities This section summarizes cash transactions that involve raising, borrowing, and repaying capital. When a company gets a bank loan or issues new shares it will receive additional cash. Therefore, this cash inflow will be reported with a positive figure. On the other hand, if the company repays the principal portion of a loan, pays dividends to its owners, or purchases its own shares it spends cash and reduces the cash balance. Therefore, this cash outflow will be reported with a negative figure. At the very bottom of the Cash Flow Statement you will find the reconciliation to the cash balance in the Balance Sheet. The cash ending balance from the last period, plus the Cash Flows from Operations, Investing and Financing Activities must equal the cash ending balance for the current period. Sometimes, you will find an additional position for effects from foreign exchange rates caused by differences in average and spot rates. 02:00 Cash Flow Statement - Overview 03:57 Cash Flow from Operations 10:33 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 11:17 Cash Flow from Financing Activities Check out the full article here: https://www.xelplus.com/cash-flow-statement-explained In the next video of our accounting basics series, we'll see how to calculate the return for an investment. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Excel 3D formulas can be used to consolidate data from multiple worksheets into a summary sheet. 3D formulas aren't that well known except to advanced Excel users. If you ever needed to reference the same cell or the same range on multiple Excel worksheets you'll know this can be quite a tedious process. Plus the reference is not dynamic. So, if another Excel sheet gets added in the middle, the formula will not update. It doesn't have to be this way! In this video I'll show you an alternative approach to gather data from multiple Excel sheets to one sheet. With Excel 3-d reference formulas you can replace this cumbersome process with a short and flexible formula. In addition, I'll show you a bonus Excel trick I received from Bob Umlas. With this hack we can even add cells or ranges on worksheets that aren't beside one another. This works as long as the sheets have a common name.

In this video I will show you the difference between accrual basis versus cash basis of accounting by telling you a story. You will get a quick overview how each of these methods impacts the timing of recording a company's transactions. In Cash Accounting companies record transactions only when cash is exchanged. This means that revenue is recorded only when cash is received. And expenses are recorded only when cash is paid. Therefore, this method is intuitive and simple to understand. It helps you keep track of your cash balance, easy to apply, and an accepted accounting method also for tax purposes. Cash accounting method can be your accounting method of choice especially if your business is small and simple, and mainly cash based. On the other hand, cash accounting may not provide a full picture of the business at a certain point in time. In Accrual Accounting companies record transactions when they happen rather than when cash changes hands. Revenue is recorded when earned, meaning when a sale is made and the products or services are delivered to the customer. Even if the customer hasn't paid yet. Expenses are recorded when incurred regardless even if they've not been paid to the supplier yet. Accrual Accounting provides a much better picture of what is happening in a business. If the company reports under GAAP or IFRS then Accrual Accounting is the accepted method. However, it does not focus on cash flows which is why reported income under this method does not equal cash-in. 00:56 What is Cash Accounting 02:38 Accrual Accounting Explained 03:27 Cash and Accrual Accounting explained with a Story 09:13 Advantages and Disadvantages for both methods Check out the full article here: https://www.xelplus.com/cash-vs-accrual-accounting In the next video of our accounting basics series, we'll take a look at the Cash Flow Statement. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

One limitation of DGET is that you can't apply it to multiple cells. Basically you can't pull down the formula to lookup different values. If that's something you need, then you'll need to use INDEX MATCH, VLOOKUP, Excel FILTER function or FILTER feature or XLOOKUP. Check out the links under Related Videos below to find these videos. Excel DGET advantages: 1. DGET is an easy formula - Excel DGET expalined (1:44) 2. DGET can look for approximate matches (6:03) 3. DGET can look for OR conditions - If either condition is met (6:28) 4. DGET can match multiple criteria (8:18) 5. DGET can lookup values to the left 6. DGET acts like an automatic filter Excel DGET disadvantages: 1. DGET formula can't be pulled down - you'll need to include the header for each lookup value 2. DGET returns an error (#Num error - 7:25) if there are duplicate lookup values in the range (as opposed to VLOOKUP or Index & Match which return the first match). ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook at the bottom of the blog post here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-dget-function ------ Related Videos ------- Excel Index Match basics: https://youtu.be/F264FpBDX28 Excel VLOOKUP explained: https://youtu.be/hwL6KKJP-_I Excel XLOOKUP: https://youtu.be/4c0CLUER6nw Excel FILTER function: https://youtu.be/Eehk6PC0oGs Check out the complete Excel Lookup Formula Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxpMnh_KKfAgp5DF9ydawmi ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You can use Excel's new FILTER function. What if you'd like to lookup multiple criteria and return ALL match results? You can use the new Excel Dynamic Array FILTER Formula! It's like the dynamic or automatic version of Excel's advanced Filter feature. You can return Filtered results based on AND as well as OR conditions. The Excel Filter function filters your data based on criteria, and returns all the matching records. This can be one or more records. If more than one match is found, the results will "spill" vertically. If there is a blockage (i.e. your results are spilling into already filled cells) then you will get the #SPILL error. You can easily get rid of this error by removing the cells that are blocking the FILTER formula. If FILTER doesn't find any matching records it will return a #CALC error. You can suppress this error with the text or value of your choice by adding this to the last argument of the FILTER formula. * Availability of Excel FILTER function: This feature is available on Excel for Office 365 - also for Excel on the Web and Mobile. Quick Navigation: 1. Advantages of Excel Filter function: 0:45 2. Excel Filter Function Explained: 1:46 3. Excel FILTER #CALC Error: 3:15 4. Excel #SPILL Error and how to overcome it: 5:40 5.

This is important when you print a large Excel spreadsheet on multiple pages. This important Excel Printing option can be found in the Page Layout tab under more options for "page setup". In the Sheet tab, you'll find an option called "Rows to repeat at top" - select the specific rows on your Excel sheet that you'd like to see on every printed page. In a similar manner you can use "Columns to repeat at left".

Check the course landing page for more info. You'd like to bring data from a web page into Excel? Instead of copying and pasting, use "Get and Transform" (Power Query) from the "Data" tab. This way you can import website data properly into Excel. Once you create a web query you can automatically get the latest data in Excel. You just have to refresh your query and update the query settings so it runs a refresh at specific intervals defined by you. Getting data from a web page has never been easier. Just Open Excel, go to the "Data" tab and click on "From Web". Enter the web address of the external page you'd like to import. Power Query opens and tries to find the html tables on that web page. Select the correct table and transform your data. This step gives you the ability to customize your output. You can for example, fill in the blanks by automatically copying down the top values. You can remove the columns you don't need and clean up the data. Once done, you can view the data in an Excel table, as an Excel Pivot Table or create a connection to the query. Note: Importing web data with Power Query this way requires the tables on the web pages to be in HTML format - otherwise they're not recognized in the Navigator view.

In this PowerPoint tips and trick tutorial learn how to merge shapes correctly in PowerPoint. This way you can create your own custom shape or typography (Font style) in PowerPoint. Understanding how to use merge shapes can be a bit tricky. Depending on whether you select Union, Combine, Fragment, Intersect or Subtract merge shape option, you will get different results. It also matters which shape you click on first before going to merge shapes options. Combining shapes properly and using a custom background image inside the merged shape will allow you to create more professional PowerPoint presentations. You can create custom fonts or typography like the "Walking Dead" title. Aside from creating custom shapes with the merge shapes feature, you also learn how to edit shapes by adjusting the points. You can also add points to each side of the shape you'd like to adjust. This allows you to alter any existing PowerPoint shape and create your own custom shape library in PowerPoint. We'll cover some useful PowerPoint shortcuts like copying shapes by holding down the control and the shift keys to make sure they are copied on the same level.

We will learn how double-entry bookkeeping takes everyday activities and turns them into data that can be processed. First, we will visualize transactions with T-Accounts (3:57), later with journal entries (8:38). Finally, we will create the resulting income statement and balance sheet to see how the accounts flow into these statements. This video will answer common questions like: - How do your write and record debits and credits? 1:22 - What is a credit with example? 2:09 - How is a journal entry recorded? 8:40 - What are COGS? 10:50 - Is expense a debit or a credit? 11:00 Overview: Debits and Credits are a fundamental part in accounting. To memorize the rules easily just remember: Accountants Don't Expect Low Earning Rates. The process of recording transactions with debits and credits is referred to as double-entry bookkeeping, because there are ALWAYS at least two accounts involved. We will follow Claudio's beach business for one day and record the transactions that happened during this day. We will start out with Claudio investing his own, private money into the business.

If you'd like to learn about the other brand new Excel functions like FILTER & UNIQUE check out the complete course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-dynamic-array-formulas In this video we cover 5 common Excel lookup problems: 1. Lookup returns an error (#NA) - This is a common problem with VLOOKUP. If the VLOOKUP function returns #NA it is likely because the item you're looking up does not exist on the lookup table. The solution so far has been to wrap the VLOOKUP function inside IFNA or IFERROR functions. With XLOOKUP however, you no longer need to do that. You just need to use the 4th argument of XLOOKUP [If_not_found] optional argument and specify the value you'd like to get back if the value does not exist on the lookup array. 2. Horizontal lookup - In legacy Excel when we needed to lookup a value in a table that was structured horizontally instead of vertically we would use the HLOOKUP function. The new XLOOkUP function can do horizontal lookups as well. You just have to select the horizontal array instead of the vertical array. 3. Look for a partial match instead of an exact match in Excel: There might be times you need to look for a partial match. In this case you can combine wildcards such as the asterisk or question mark characters and combine them together with the 5th argument of XLOOKUP which is the optional [match mode] argument. 4. Two way Excel lookup: To look up a value on the rows as well as columns we generally combined VLOOKUP with Excel Match function or used the famous INDEX & MATCH functions. We no longer need to use two separate functions to do a two way lookup. We can use XLOOKUP inside another XLOOKUP to get the job done. The advantage is we just need to know one function well, instead of combining different Excel lookup functions with one another. 5. Excel approximate match lookup: There are times you'd like to look for a value inside a data table and return the closest match. This is specially used for cases where you have thresholds for example for bonus schemes. If a number falls between a specific threshold you'd like to return a corresponding value. This is where you can use XLOOKUP's 5th argument [match mode] to look for "exact match or next smaller item" or "exact match or next larger item".

By the end of this tutorial you will understand the difference between debits and credits in accounting. You will have your cheat sheet to refer to when it comes to understanding whether a transaction needs to be debited or credited. You will also understand debit and credit in banking and why banks use the terminology that seems confusing: debit card and credit card. You'll understand how that fits with our debit and credit examples. Overview: Debits and Credits are a fundamental part in accounting. Debits and Credits affect accounts differently depending on the type of account. To memorize the rules easily just remember: Accountants Don't Expect Low Earning Rates. Debits and Credits always go together. Every transaction will have Debits and Credits and at least two accounts will be affected. If one account is debited then another one must be credited. Just think of it like a bank transfer. When you send someone money it comes out of your bank account and goes into their account. The process of recording transactions with debits and credits is referred to as double-entry accounting, because there are ALWAYS at least two accounts involved. There can be more than 2 accounts involved in one transaction but never less than 2. We call this a flow of economic benefit from a source to a destination. Assets, Dividends, and Expenses are Debits. The balance of these accounts increases with debits and decrease with credits. Liabilities, Equity, and Revenues are Credits. The balance of these accounts increases with credits and decrease with debits.

It's not easy if you use VLOOKUP. You either need to use a workaround or INDEX and MATCH. With the Excel's XLOOKUP function we can use one single formula to do a left lookup in Excel. It's super easy because XLOOKUP takes the best of VLOOKUP and INDEX & MATCH formulas. We have a separate independent lookup range and a separate return range. *** Availability of XLOOKUP: XLOOKUP is available in Excel for Office 365.

The balance sheet is one of the three main financial statements and it provides information about a company’s financial position at a certain point in time. If you want to understand the financial health of a business that’s the place to start. However, please note that’s it’s just a snapshot a certain point in time: It does NOT show the flows into and out of the accounts during the period. The balance sheet provides information on the company’s Assets, Liabilities and Equity. Assets are the resources the company owns and uses, and Liabilities is what it owes to others. Equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities. This leftover money belongs to the owners of the company. Therefore, the more assets a company has and the smaller its debt, the bigger equity will be. It all comes back to the main accounting equation: Assets equal Liabilities plus Equity or if we rearrange: Equity equals Assets minus Liabilities. A higher value for assets, a lower value for liabilities equals higher equity.

The Complete Excel Essentials course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/learn-excel-essentials Flash Fill in Excel is similar to Autofill except it will fill the values down based on a certain logic. That logic is derived automatically once Excel sees a pattern in the data. There are different ways you can use flash fill: 1. Use the Excel shortcut key for Flashfill: Control + E 2. Pull down the values with the fill handle and then select Flash Fill 3. Go to Home / Fill / Flash Fill 4. Start typing the 2nd value and once Excel recognizes the pattern, you will see the results shown in the cells in light grey. Just Press Enter. Excel Flash Fill not working? Check out 2:02. You can only apply Flash Fill close and adjacent to your data set. You can also apply Flash Fill one column at a time. For example to split first name and last name, you can do the first name first and then do the last name separately. For Flash Fill to work it also needs to recognize a pattern. For really messy data, it might not find a consistent pattern. If for some reason Excel doesn't show you the Flash Fill preview, it might be turned off in your Excel Options. To make sure Flash Fill is turned on go to File - Options - Advanced Editing Options - put a check mark in the "Automatically Flash Fill" box. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-flash-fill LINKS to Excel Basics Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyx1KSoobwukzf1Nf-Y97Rw0 Change Case of Text in Excel: https://youtu.be/LN6BB5p6lGc ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Did you know you can create an Outlook email from Excel? You can even create it with an Excel formula using cell references for mailto, subject and cc? The Excel Hyperlink formula gives you the ability to create dynamic emails. In this video you will learn how to use the Excel Hyperlink feature to create a manual email hyperlink. As we're doing this step, we learn some key components of the Hyperlink feature that will enable us to make the process dynamic by using Excel's Hyperlink Function. This Excel tutorial will also show you how you can get creative with the Hyperlink function. We will use the Excel IF Function to create two different types of emails depending on whether goals were reached or not. We will also use some of Excel's text functions like TRIM and LEFT function to grab the part of the text we need for our email. What to do if you need: Excel email with Multiple Mailto: If you'd like to have multiple recipients for the mailto address, just add the email addresses in the same cell and separate them with a semicolon. Add a Line break to email body: To add a link break in the email body, you can us the carriage return character (%0A). Beware of Excel's formula 255 character limit - you can't use the Hyperlink formula for extra long emails. Keep the [friendly name] as short as you can to allow for more characters in the rest of the email. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/send-email-from-excel-with-hyperlink-formula Excel IF Function Tutorial: https://youtu.be/KkTaQ5OjAGc ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Here are 5 design tips for creating optimal column charts. The tips are based on a study conducted which uses eye-tracking technology to get insights on how we read and understand charts (see link below). This is how eye-tacking tests are done: The participant is presented with a question which they need to answer by looking at the visualization on the screen while the camera is tracking their eye movements. Two parameters are measured. One is effectiveness – which means was the answer correct and number two is efficiency, which means how fast were they able to respond.

They will get Excel's open File Dialog Box and they can browse and select the workbook to copy the data from. We use VBA GetOpenFilename method to Open the workbook selected in the background, copy the data and then close the workbook. The user will not even realize the other workbook was opened in the background. I will also show you how to avoid getting the message "method getopenfilename of '_application' failed". This is a common error when using the application.getopenfilename method and it can easily be avoided by declaring the correct variable type.

Check the course landing page for more info. It sounds simple to just switch columns to rows - basically transpose horizontal data to vertical. BUT you can't always use a simple transpose (neither the transpose feature nor the Transpose function) if you only need to transpose parts of your data set. Some columns, instead of all columns. For example if you have a report in Excel with a list of months in the columns, it would be easier to analyze the data and create formulas or pivot tables on the data, If your data is in a tabular format. For each value field in the original report, we will get a new row. Since this involves unpivoting or transposing parts of the data, it can be difficult to achieve with Excel formulas. This is where you can use Excel's "Get & Transform" feature - (also called Power Query). Get & Transform is available since Excel 2016. All you need to do is create a table or a named range from your source data and then unpivot the columns in the Power Query editor. If some of the value cells in your report happen to be empty - the entire row will be removed in the final table. To keep empty cells, you need to replace the null value in Power Query with 0. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-powerquery-transpose-unpivot/ LINKS to related videos: 3 ways to transpose: https://youtu.be/yYVokk0NdiI R1C1 trick to transpose: https://youtu.be/dF0cVRyC8c4 Unstack data: https://youtu.be/rscXNUlRsH0 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

If you need to lookup a value on another Excel sheet or table, you can use the XLOOKUP function. Here are some of its features: - XLOOKUP can lookup values to the left OR right-hand side of the lookup range. - XLOOKUP looks for an exact match by default (you can change it if you like) - Use XLOOKUP to look for the next smallest value or the next largest value (approximate or close match) - XLOOKUP can do vertical AND horizontal lookups - XLOOKUP can find the first match or the last match (reverse lookup) And guess what? XLOOKUP can also be combined with another XLOOKUP to lookup values inside a matrix - which means XLOOKUP can replace INDEX & MATCH formulas too! ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-xlookup-explained VLOOKUP tutorial: https://youtu.be/hwL6KKJP-_I Playlist for Excel LOOKUP formulas: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxpMnh_KKfAgp5DF9ydawmi ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Time Stamps: 00:00 What is Excel XLOOKUP 00:55 XLOOKUP Basic Function 02:50 Get Last Match with XLOOKUP Search Mode 03:54 Get Next Smaller Match with XLOOKUP Match Mode 05:51 Why Excel XLOOKUP is Better than VLOOKUP Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

This Progress circle chart infographic is different to what you've seen before. Just like the other progress circle charts it uses the doughnut chart as the basis. A text box is placed in the middle of the progress chart (I will show you an Excel chart trick to embed the text box inside the chart object). The value of the text box is connected to the percentage completed value which is input in a cell. What makes this chart different to the rest? It's a small design tweak that makes THIS progress circle chart look more professional. This chart comes with ROUNDED EDGES. This seems like a small tweak, but there isn't a simple option in Excel to get the inside shape have rounded edges. In this video you'll find two versions to create this Excel progress chart infographic with rounded edges (or the doughnut chart with rounded edges): Version #1 (by me) - It requires a simple tweak to the border of the chart. This brings us halfway there but it doesn't give the professional look we're going after. Version #2 (by Sam Dekoven): This version has perfectly rounded edges for the doughnut chart and it uses a smart technique which combines a scatter plot series with the doughnut chart (together with the SIN COS and PI Excel Functions). Many thanks to Sam for sharing his version with all of us! ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-progress-circle-chart LINKS to Excel infographic chart playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyw08u-MZm4ROnB3J0gRlsop Advanced Chart Techniques: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyyEj7oQkCf7TL9yQQWXbGOQ ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Let's say you're writing a set of instructions. By default the text entered overflows to the next cells. Now let's say you'd like to cap the overflow so the text doesn't go over too may columns. You can do that with Excel's Fill Justify feature. With ONE click you can properly align and arrange your text in a readable format. Justify automatically cuts the overflowing text and pastes it in the cells below. It also works the other way round. You can bring text from multiple rows in one single cell! ** Watch Out for Excel's 255 character limit: If your first cell has text with more than 255 characters and you Fill Justify down - then the remainder of the text is deleted. You DON'T run into a problem if you Justify text from multiple columns to one cell - Excel puts the remainder on the row below. ⯆ Blog Post: https://www.xelplus.com/microsoft-excel-justify-text LINK to Excel TIPS & HACKS playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxVeel8DFjewBSlZYdfd38A LINK to Excel basics playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyx1KSoobwukzf1Nf-Y97Rw0 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

If you have Excel for Office 365 or Excel 2019, you can use MAXIFS and MINIFS functions which allow us to find the maximum or minimum value in a data set based on multiple conditions. For example if you wanted to find the MIN value but exclude zero values, you can use the MINIFS function to do that. If you have an older version of Excel, you can use an alternate method. The common solution is {=Max(If (array) )} but you need to press Control Shift Enter (CSE). Another method to get the maximum or minimum value based on criteria is to use the AGGREGATE function. The advantage of AGGREGATE is you don't need to press control shift enter. Just enter. You need a little trick to get to work. We cover that in this video. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-maxifs-minifs-with-conditions More IFS functions - like SUMIFS: https://youtu.be/AZuBNWMh7VM ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Link to the complete course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-vba-excel-macros We achieve this with a simple Excel VBA function. The VBA function has two arguments. One is for color and the other the range that needs to be summed. You can use a similar technique to count cells based on color. We also improve on the VBA code to have the formula results update automatically when a cell color in the range changes. This is done by using the worksheet selection change event for a specific range. We achieve this with the Application.Intersect method. ⯆ Blog post & DOWNLOAD the workbook: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-sum-cells-by-color-vba/ LINK to Excel VBA Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyzmbDy6QoBuUDrU5D-jD-Se ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

For example, you'd like to check IF a cell contains a specific word. If yes, then you'd like a specific result, otherwise you'd like another result. We also take a look at checking the data against multiple partial match strings. If you're familiar with the IF function, you know the logical test argument looks for an exact match. In case you'd like to look for a partial match in the IF formula (Excel IF function with text containing another word), you can't use an asterisk sign just like you would in the SUMIFS or COUNTIFS formulas. Instead you need to either use the SEARCH or the FIND functions. These will act as your wildcards. You can apply the same approach to the SUMPRODUCT function. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/if-function-with-wildcard-partial-text-match/ LINKS to related videos: Partial match in SUMIFS function: https://youtu.be/2h90wU9jicI Learn how IF function works: https://youtu.be/KkTaQ5OjAGc ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You can use a simple Excel hack to get this done. In my previous video (https://youtu.be/yYVokk0NdiI) I talk about 2 other methods you can use. One method is to copy the data and paste special and select transpose. This way however the data is static. Another option is to use the Excel TRANSPOSE function. One thing I don't like about the Transpose formula is that it's an array function and you need to remember to press Control shift enter (at least until you get dynamic array functionality). You also need to highlight the answer area first before inputting the Transpose formula. This Excel hack is really simple. It's also dynamic and you can also account for additional cells. I came across this from Bob Umlas (his Excel books are great by the way). All you need to do is briefly switch to Excel's R1C1 referencing style. Find out more in the video. ⯆ Blog post and Workbook: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-horizontal-data-to-vertical/ LINKS to related videos: 3 ways to Transpose (including Transpose function): https://youtu.be/yYVokk0NdiI Unstack Excel data: https://youtu.be/rscXNUlRsH0 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You can also use the same code to print preview multiple worksheets in one Excel print preview window. ★ Complete Excel VBA and macros course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-vba-excel-macros This VBA tutorial builds on the a previous video where we displayed all worksheets in an Excel ActiveX Combo Box - selecting a sheet name from the combo box, sent the user to the respective sheet. This time we will be using an ActiveX ListBox to allow the user to print the selected sheets in one go. We will use the Excel Worksheet Activate event to automatically populate the list of sheet names in the List Box. We will then use the VBA For Next Loop to create a string array of the sheet names that were selected. To do this, we will use the VBA redim preserve command. Finally we assign a command button (and later an icon) to run the macro once the user clicks it. Aside from this, you will also learn how to debug your macros by stepping into the VBA code and using the locals window. You also learn about VBA's object library and how you can search for specific objects to learn which methods, properties and events are associated with them. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/list-box-to-print-multiple-sheets-excel-vba/ LINKS to related videos - Excel ActiveX Combo Box to Select Sheets with VBA: https://youtu.be/bUMS_BCF08g ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

This way you can quickly switch text to upper case (i.e. all caps), to lower case and to proper case (first letter of every word is in capital letter and the rest are lower case letters). Here is an overview of the three methods: 1. Excel's Text Formulas - We use the UPPER, LOWER and PROPER functions - as well as the TRIM function to get rid of any additional spaces in between words - also space before or after words. 2. Excel Flash Fill - The advantage of flash fill is that you don't need formulas, the disadvantage is that it's not dynamic. If your source data change, you have to apply flash fill again. 3. Use an ALL CAPS font. There are fonts that don't have lower case version. They are purely all caps fonts. Office has a few available by default, but you can download and install other fonts from websites like dafont.com ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-change-case-of-text/ Excel Basics Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyx1KSoobwukzf1Nf-Y97Rw0 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

With this method you can conditionally format the series of any chart you'd like. For example, to highlight the months that had the highest values or to highlight the data points in red if they are below target and green if above target - or to add conditional data labels to the chart series.

I also show you how the RANK function works and the difference between Rank.EQ and Rank.AVG functions. We also take a look at understanding how complex Excel array formulas such as SUMPRODUCT with criteria works by breaking down the formula. 0:51 - RANK Function & RANK.EQ 3:30 - RANK duplicates but don't skip numbers in between 6:51 - Top 3 Report 8:51 SUMPRODUCT & COUNTIF Excel Array formula explained You might need to create a top 10 or top 3 report in Excel. For example you'd like to get the top 3 values but there are two categories that have the exact same value and both are considered number 2. How can you show both categories as number 2 and not just the first one? VLOOKUP will not help here, because it will return the first match. You'd like ALL matches returned. The solution uses the SUMPRODUCT function together with the Excel COUNTIF function to get the ranking. We then use the TEXTJOIN and IF functions together as an array to get the category names ranked in ascending order. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-rank-without-skipping-numbers/ LINKS to related videos: Excel TextJoin Function - https://youtu.be/TMZEUlFGp1U Excel Lookup Formulas Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyxpMnh_KKfAgp5DF9ydawmi ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

(Excel Text to Columns)	Check the Excel Essentials Course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/learn-excel-essentials This tutorial uses Excel's Text to Columns feature to address two common Excel problems. Problem 1: VLOOKUP formula doesn't work One common reason for your VLOOKUP formulas or SUMIFS formulas not working is that Excel doesn't recognize the numbers as numbers. It sees them as text. Even if you change the cell custom formatting from General to a Number, your formulas still don't work. This is a common issue when you import data to Excel from SAP or Oracle systems. Problem 2: Dates are not recognized as dates in Excel. - sometimes imported dates from other systems to Excel are seen as text or number but not as a date. Excel's text to column feature can convert these super fast into dates. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook & read the article: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-text-to-columns/ LINKS to related videos: VLOOKUP - https://youtu.be/hwL6KKJP-_I ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Hiding many worksheets at once is easy in Excel. Click on a sheet, hold down the control or the shift key, click on the other sheets you'd like to hide, right-mouse click and select hide. Now what if you wanted to unhide all the sheets in one go? If you right-mouse click on any sheet name and select unhide - a new window opens with a list of hidden sheets. Unfortunately you can't use the control key or the shift key to select multiple sheets to unhide. You have to unhide tabs one by one. Find out 3 methods you can use to un-hide: 1. Use Custom views to quickly unhide all sheets - no Excel VBA is needed here 2. Use the Immediate Window in VBA - type in or copy and paste a very simple macro 3. Save the macro in your Excel personal macro Workbook. You can add a button for the macro to your Quick Access Toolbar so it is available for ALL your Excel workbooks - also the ones that are not macro-enabled (just xlsx). ⯆ Blog Post: https://www.xelplus.com/3-methods-to-unhide-all-sheets-in-excel/ LINKS to related videos: Excel VBA FOR EACH Loop: https://youtu.be/5bq3N99mNPE Excel VBA full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyzmbDy6QoBuUDrU5D-jD-Se ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

The problem we get with dependent data validation lists is that when you change the value of the first data validation, the value for the dependent data validation stays there until you activate the drop-down. This can be misleading. In this video, you will learn how to automatically reset the value of the dependent list to say "please select" the moment the value in the first drop-down list changes. We do this with Excel VBA, using the change event procedure. The default worksheet procedure is Selection Change event. This triggers every time you change the active cell. It's more optimal in this case to use the worksheet change procedure and make sure that it only run if the value of a specific cell is changed. We don't want to trigger the change procedure every time any cell value is changed. The simple Excel macro show you how you can set it up from scratch. Once you're done, make sure you save the workbook as a macro-enabled workbook. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/reset-dependent-drop-down/ LINKS to related videos: Dependent data validation in Excel: https://youtu.be/w7cHgsFirLk Dependent Combo Box: https://youtu.be/aSPtWo3IiOM VBA IF THEN Statement: https://youtu.be/dUSQ7wZHM7A VBA Message Box: https://youtu.be/EwbTFvXBfns Full VBA playlist on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyzmbDy6QoBuUDrU5D-jD-Se ★ My Online Excel Courses (including VBA) ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

This is great for cases when you need to sum a column based on "criteria contains" a specific value or text. For these cases you can use Excel's SUMIF or SUMIFS function together with wildcards. Examples of wildcards are the asterisk "*" sign or the Question mark "?". The asterisk is a placeholder for zero or more characters. The ? mark is a fixed placeholder in terms of the numbers of characters. If you use the question mark once, this means only one character can be variable. If you use it two times, then two characters can be "anything". You can combine the question mark together with the asterisk sign as well. I show different examples on how you can do that in this video. I also show you how you can sum based on two or more conditions. Here the SUMIFS formula comes in really handy. ⯆ DOWNLOAD the workbook here: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-sum-partial-text-match/ LINKS to related videos: Absolute Relative referencing: https://youtu.be/FRu48zy-Djk Excel SUMIFS Basics: https://youtu.be/AZuBNWMh7VM SUMIFS between Dates: https://youtu.be/XIhbL20jTHc ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You can then decide what to do if they exist. For example you can open the Workbook to copy values from and then close the workbook. I will also show you how you can handle cases where the file does not exist or the file name is not typed correctly. In that case VBA generates an error but you can easily avoid with the IF statement. [5:10] I also show you how you can check with VBA if a folder exists. and if it doesn't exist, how you can create the folder.

Excel Dynamic Array formulas are new to Excel Office 365. Don't miss out on their full potential. ★★ Link to complete Excel Dynamic Arrays Course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-dynamic-array-formulas Complex tasks will be done with simple Excel formulas. Everything you wished Excel could do, can now be done! In this video, I take two of my popular videos which use traditional Excel complex formulas and use Dynamic array formulas instead. I also use a timer to test the time needed for the new formulas and compare it to the other videos. Here's what happens: We create a dynamic dependent drop-down list based on a messy data set. The first list includes unique values from cells and the second dependent data validation list filters the values to the ones that belong to the category selected from the first list. I also make sure the list is dynamic so if we add more data to the table, the drop-down list will automatically update (here we use the new dynamic array spill range reference #) I also use the sort function to get sorted names in the drop-down list. We use 3 Excel dynamic array functions: Unique, Sort & filter.

I show 2 practical examples of the VLOOKUP formula. I also explain why your VLOOKUP formula might not be working correctly. Summary: The Excel VLOOKUP formula looks up a value in an Excel table and returns a value from an adjacent column. "V" stands for vertical lookup. This is one of most common lookup functions in Excel. If your data table is not sorted, it's important to look for an exact match - this means you can't omit the last argument of vlookup. You need to set that argument to "false" or to 0. 🡻 Download the workbook here 🡻 https://www.xelplus.com/basics-vlookup-hlookup/ ★ Links to related videos: ★ For reverse or 2-way lookup problems use INDEX & MATCH: https://youtu.be/F264FpBDX28 Relative & Absolute referencing: https://youtu.be/FRu48zy-Djk ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my Excel top 10 tips and formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

That's what I try to do using Excel's FREQUENCY function, Form Controls, MAX formula & 3D models. My solution is an Excel dynamic bar chart with icons. It's not your standard bar chart. It's an Excel chart that's conditionally formatted: The highest value is conditionally formatted with an icon. The icons are automatically hidden for the remaining bars. We use a trick to get it conditionally formatted. There are a lot of Excel chart tricks used here if you pay close attention. I'll also show you how you can use 3Dmodels in PowerPoint at the end of the video. This is solution entry to Oz du Soleil's #ExcelHash competition.

What parameters are required. How to look for partial matches or for complete matches (whole word). Also if VBA should search in the cells, formulas or comments. I also show you how to handle cases if VBA FIND doesn't find a value. So in cases where your text or value is not found. You'll want to account for this, because in case your text or value is not found, you'll get a VBA error. In order to avoid the error, you can use the VBA IF statement. This ensures that if a value is not found, you will not end up with an error, instead you can decide what you'd like to do (in the video I'll show you how to create a custom message box, informing the user that the value was not found). ★ Links to related videos: ★ Check out the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmHVyfmcRKyzmbDy6QoBuUDrU5D-jD-Se ★ My Online Excel Courses ★ Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

This reduces mistakes upon data entry. In this video, I show you how to use Excel's custom data validation feature to validate for complex combinations. You'll learn how to use formulas for creating your data validation. Here we write a formula in the custom data validation box that checks for a specific combination of text and numbers. In the first example we take a look at validating for 1 letter and 4 numbers. In the 2nd example we look for specific characters inside the text and the last example we take a look at how we can validate for a combination of 2 letters and 4 numbers. We also cover Excel's LEN, RIGHT, LEFT and MID functions.

Declaring variables means that you give VBA a heads up that it needs to free up some memory space for your variables which will in most cases be less than the default. That's why it's important to understand the concept of data types and how much memory space each of these types will take. The less memory you allocate to a variable, the faster your code will run. I show the range associated to each data type - such as numbers, text, date, currency etc in the video. By default VBA assigns the data type “variant” to each variable. Variant means it changes depending on the data type so is it text, number or date. It will allocate around 16 bytes of memory if it’s a number and 22 bytes + length of string. ★★ Get the complete Excel VBA course here: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/excel-vba-excel-macros ★ Links to related videos: ★ Learn about Visual Basic Editor: https://youtu.be/NpvvwrdDcQk Properties & methods in VBA: https://youtu.be/uYHrzo2gzbo Blog Post: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-vba-data-types-dim-set/ ★ My Online Excel Courses ★ Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

We use the copy method as well as the pastespecial method. The copy method in VBA, copies data, as well as formatting, formulas, comments etc - with the pastespecial method, you have more control over your paste options. For example, you can paste formatting only - or choose to paste values as well as number formatting. I also show you how to use the resize property, so you can change the size of the current region before you copy. This is good for cases where you want to copy the data but exclude the header.

It's important to be aware of the different ways you can write to Excel cells with VBA or macros. The macro recorder has its own preference when writing to ranges but it's not the only way. You'll be surprised at all the available options. Each method has its own advantages. They will become more obvious later on when you learn to loop inside a range in Excel. You'll learn how to use ranges, cells property, offset, named ranges, difference between activecell and selection, and how to reference entire rows or entire columns and also how to use autofit in Excel VBA. Practice along with me by opening up a blank Excel spreadsheet. Make sure you close other spreadsheets as we'll be writing to the active Workbook.

Check the Excel Essentials Course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/learn-excel-essentials We cover a few examples in this tutorial including: 1. Simple IF function (also with greater than or less than checks). 2. IF Formula together with AND logical test to decide outcome if more than one condition is met. 3. Nested IF formula (an IF inside another IF) to check for multiple criteria. 4. IF formula with OR function (to check if "either" condition is met and then decide the outcome). 5. We also take a look at using formulas (other calculations) inside the IF function and finally: 6. How to use symbols as the result of the IF formula Your IF formula isn't working? One of the main mistakes is the "else" argument. That's the last argument inside the IF function. Make sure you haven't forgotten to specify what should happen "if" the condition isn't met. In case you have more than one condition, here's the place to add the second "if" statement. An IF formula inside another IF formula is called a nested if function.

Also Conditionally formats the largest values on the map for improved readability. Learn how to create a simple but impressive dynamic map chart that enables you to visualize specific KPI's by geography. This method doesn't use the relatively new Bing map feature, so it is works on all Excel versions. The technique shown uses a scatter plot first to set up the respective points on the map and then turns it into a bubble chart to be able to visualize the actual KPI. I also show you how you can conditionally format specific data points to bring the attention to certain categories. In this case I conditionally format the largest data point in the chart in a different color than the rest. This technique is really simple but has a very powerful effect. It makes the difference between a "nice" Excel dashboard to a "great" Excel dashboard. All it takes is 3 minutes of your time.

In this example, we are going to conditionally format the result of our lookup formula (I use INDEX Match here) to conditionally format that same value that we find inside the original data set. The tricky part is to get the conditional formatting formula correct. Just remember, one reason why your conditional formatting formulas might not work can be due to the wrong usage of the dollar sign for fixing the cell references (i.e. absolute, versus relative referencing - and sometimes you need a mix of the two).

You can also download the template from the link below. What is a Step Chart? A Step Chart is great for visualizing variables that change on an irregular basis. For example price and inventory changes. If you create a line chart directly on the data set you will realize it doesn't show the correct visualization. For the correct visualization you need a data preparation table that plots two points for each value. One point represents the value before the change and the second point the value after the change. Once you get past this step, you can further improve the readability of the Excel Step Chart by taking additional steps to bring the data labels inside the chart instead of relying on the axis. This improves the readability of the chart. The last part of the video shows you how to create a fully dynamic Step Chart so that when new dates are added, the chart updates automatically. We do this with Excel's OFFSET function and Name Manager to create dynamic chart ranges. ★★ Contributions ★★ Thanks to Bart Titulaer (Lecturer at Fontys International Business School in Venlo, Netherlands) for providing the Step Chart Template. 🡻 Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/how-to-create-step-chart-in-excel/ Other fun chart tricks: Info Charts (non standard graphs): https://youtu.be/C9beIaL-cBA Dynamic drop-down: https://youtu.be/22jcw5slQJk Changing chart ranges: https://youtu.be/sHfWRb2yUrM ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

And you'd like to do this with an Excel formula? This video is for you. As a first step I use formulas to extract the list of unique items to separate cells. My method includes a combination of the Index function together with Match and the Countif function. I'll show you a way to also avoid CSE (control shift enter) as well. In the second part of the video, I use the Offset formula to create a dynamic list that expands depending on the number of items that should be included in the list.

This type of chart is not available in the standard Excel chart selection. With a few steps, you'll learn how to create this from scratch. One way of creating a clustered and stacked column chart combination is to use both the primary and secondary Y-axis. One problem you'll run into is that they will likely have a different minimum and maximum which will show the wrong visualization. You need to ensure that both the primary and secondary y-axis have the same minimum and maximum in a dynamic way (without manually fixing these values).

In Excel it's relatively easy to lookup values in one specific tab. But how do you lookup values in multiple tabs using just one single formula? In the video, I show you different versions of getting this done. One version uses VLOOKUP and direct worksheet and cell references. The other version uses INDEX & MATCH and Excel table names and references. The key here is the INDIRECT function which acts as the messenger which returns the correct address to the different lookup formulas. Of course, you can apply this (indirect) method inside other formulas. 🡻 Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/lookup-values-across-multiple-worksheets-excel/ Links to related videos: VLOOKUP explained ► https://youtu.be/E7gQ-PgYkMc INDEX MATCH Basics ► https://youtu.be/F264FpBDX28 INDIRECT explained ► https://youtu.be/GUClkvJ7Gag ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Instead of having the contents of each drop-down beside each other as we had in the previous tutorial, we now have the contents of each drop-down right below one another. To distinguish which category belongs to which parent, the parent is listed right beside the category. This provides us with a table that has two columns. One for the parent and the other for the content. We would like to come up with a dynamic formula so that when the user selects a category from the first drop-down (i.e. the parent list), Excel figures out which part of the tabular data-set to include in the 2nd drop-down. This means we need a dynamic formula that always shows the part of the table that has a match for the parent category.

In that video the first list contained numbers whereas in this video we take a look at a more realistic case where the first list contains text with multiple words and spaces. This approach works if your drop downs are in different worksheets as well.

In this specific video we take a look at presenting data in Excel Tables and how we can better organize the data, headers, distance etc to create tables that are easy to read. We also take a look at using conditional formatting in our report such as data-bars to bring attention to deviations - especially the bigger changes. An alternative approach is to use custom formatting and use symbols and color to bring attention to the positive and negative deviations. You'll see some neat tricks here that allow you to better organize your data in tables so that attention is directed to areas that need attention most. This makes the entire report easier to read and digest. ⯆ Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/report-makeover-excel-better-excel-tables/ Link to BMW 2015 Annual report: http://bit.ly/BMWPDF2015 Link to Video 1 - Table or Chart? https://youtu.be/BJTrAmnK5LY Link to Video 2 - Alternative to Doughnut Charts: https://youtu.be/U3U5A0BCr9A More on Custom Formatting: https://youtu.be/tGY70sdpaLc ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Doughnut graphs are very similar to Pie Charts except they use less ink. A better alternative to the Doughnut chart is a sorted bar chart. In this video I show you how you can set up your data preparation table in Excel using the Rank Function to automatically sort the data and categories in descending order. I also show you how to hard-proof your formulas to avoid duplicate ranks - i.e. to ensure we have unique ranks in the data set. ⯆ Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-report-makeover-alternative-for-doughnut-charts/ Link to Part 1: https://youtu.be/BJTrAmnK5LY Link to Part 3: https://youtu.be/xLmi3PUDg9k Link to Learn Index & Match: https://youtu.be/F264FpBDX28 Link to BMW 2015 Annual report: http://bit.ly/BMWPDF2015 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Excel Table (Part 1)	Check the Excel Essentials Course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/learn-excel-essentials In this case study we take a look at the 2015 Annual Report from BMW and look at ways we could improve on some of the tables and graphs used in the report. Of course I will use Microsoft Excel for this. It's sometimes difficult to decide which visualization to use for which data sets. Specially when it comes to visualizing financial numbers in corporate reports. Sometimes it helps to test different versions - which you can easily do in Excel and then put them side by side. Or give the different versions as handouts to your team and decide which is the easiest and fastest to read. ⯆ Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/bmw-report-makeover-graph-versus-table/ View Part 2: Alternative to Donut charts https://youtu.be/U3U5A0BCr9A View Part 3: Better Excel Tables https://youtu.be/xLmi3PUDg9k In this video we take a look at a specific table which compares sales volume of 2015 by Mini model with previous year's values. In addition it shows the proportion of sales volume for each Mini Model as compared to the total. There is a lot of information in the table. Could we show this better with a chart? or should we stick to a table?

It finds the optimal solution to a problem by changing multiple variables. Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-solver-example It can solve for more complex “what-if-analysis” which Goal Seek can’t. Goal seek is restricted to changing one variable, whereas with solver you can have many variables. Calling Solver an “advanced goal seek” doesn’t do it any justice. Solver can handle complex data models and solve for the optimal solution. But; it can also easily solve for the more simpler problems that we might face at work. In this video, I show you two examples: 1 - How to set income to a specific value by changing prices which adding constraints for the price and also full rounded number for units sold. 2.

Find out now, because it can save you time. Read the article: https://www.xelplus.com/excel-goal-seek/ Excel's Goal Seek tool is in the Data Tools Tab as a part of What-If Analysis in the Excel Ribbon. Goal seek can be described as follows: • It is the opposite of a formula: instead of finding the end result, you give it the end result and it gives you the input • It eliminates the trial and error process • It is like guessing on speed. It’s useful for situations where you want quick answers • It is a simplified Solver The main advantage of Goal seek is that you don’t have to change your Excel formulas or turn a formula field to an input field.

An Excel theme is defined by the combination of color, font and effects. You can define combinations of these and save the combination as a theme. These themes are available throughout the Office applications. In Excel it's not as easy as in Word to set a theme as default, so that every time you open a new Excel Workbook, it takes your own theme instead of the default Office theme. You just have to save an empty spreadsheet with your theme as an Excel template and save it in the XLSTART folder.

This example builds on the example shown in the previous videos which has a matrix of apps which belong to different divisions. The apps are the values inside the matrix and the divisions are the headers. The aim is to find the header value based on the matrix value. Since the data in this example is not unique and an app can belong to more than one division, the aim is to come up with a formula that finds all the divisions one app could belong to. Excel's TEXTJOIN function is a great solution to this problem. On top, when combined with the Find & Isnumber function, it can help us avoid duplicate results.

Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/smart-uses-of-custom-formatting-part-2/ Method #3: Use any symbol of your choice to show deviations and conditionally format these using custom formatting Method #4: Use custom formatting to only show higher or lower deviations, i.e. use thresholds in custom formatting. The general custom formatting syntax that most are familiar with, is to format positive, negative, zero and text values. But you can also use custom formatting to format higher, lower and medium boundaries. In this video you'll see how that works. For part 1 watch: https://youtu.be/tGY70sdpaLc For part 3 watch: https://youtu.be/qKpxEl-_IQ8 - you'll find out how you can account for 4 conditional thresholds.

Download the workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/smart-uses-of-custom-formatting/ For Part 2 watch: https://youtu.be/faPSXNkU1Y0 We normally use custom formatting to show numbers with thousand separator, as percentage or even to show green for positive and red for negative values. Basically to format the numbers in our reports. But we hardly ever use custom formatting to show deviations with symbols. Or to disguise our numbers to look like symbols instead. The trick is super simple. In this video, I show you a simple way of showing variances using symbols - up/down arrows or any symbol of your choice - with Excel's custom formatting. All you need to know is the rule behind custom formatting - i.e. first argument is how positive numbers should be formatted, then how negative numbers should be formatted, followed by how zero values should be shown and last text. Custom formatting can be confusing, but if you remember this simple rule, you're all set. I cover this also in my free PDF eBook which you can get from my website (see link below) Why would you want to use custom instead of conditional formatting? 1. Your files will process faster. 2. It's super easy to setup! This video belongs to a 2 part series. This is part 1 of 2. In the next video, I will show you how you can add thresholds to your deviations using custom formatting.

Link to complete course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/professional-excel-dashboards Downloadable workbook available inside the course. In this lecture you will learn how to create a dynamic chart ranges - assume your raw data table is quite big and you'd like the user to specify from which category or date - and to which category & date, they'd like to view the chart data from. Excel Offset function is one formula that you can use to create dynamic ranges, but Excel's Index formula is a great alternative to the OFFSET function AND it's not a volatile function. Once we've figured out the right INDEX formula, we will copy and paste this into name manager and use the name for our chart range. This will provide us with a dynamic chart that only shows the user the range they'd like to view.

This is a great Excel formula for anyone planning deadlines and needs to find the number of working days available to them. This function excludes weekends as well. If you use NETWORKDAYS.INTL you can decide which days are considered weekends and should be excluded. I also show you a way to make the selection for holidays dynamic. For example, if you are doing a project in one country and want to roll out that same project in other countries and you’d like the number of working days between the two dates to consider the holidays of the chosen country – the index function can come to the rescue. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Some examples are - creating a project timeline - creating a reporting timetable In this video I show you both examples. Excel's workday function assumes weekends fall on Saturdays and Sundays.

In the first video (https://youtu.be/A3NfEkf8S0o), I showed you how you can use conditional formatting in Excel Column or Excel Bar charts. I also showed you how you can conditionally format the data labels in Excel graphs to show a different color if the values are positive to when the values are negative. In the second video: https://youtu.be/73s3qej4vi0 I showed you how you can use the Excel error bar technique to create really thin bars (or thick lines) which has a more subtle effect. The result is a visually effective chart that doesn't distract the readers attention from the main chart but also communicates the difference to previous year visually as well.

Also what to watch out for when you're using it. INDIRECT can be very useful in Excel Dashboards when you need a dynamic cell reference instead of hard-coding the reference in a formula. For example, let's say you have a drop down where the user can select for which year the revenue should be shown. Depending on the selection the formula with a SUMIF or SUMIFS function should sum up different ranges of data. Instead of writing a long formula with different conditions for each year that could be chosen, you can use INDIRECT. Get the full Excel Dashboard course here: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/professional-excel-dashboards Indirect can be a confusing function. It takes a little bit time to get the hang of it. What Indirect does, is it returns an address. So for example, if you type in =indirect(A1) and inside A1, you have written A10 - then your formula returns what is inside A10. Why would you need this?

For example when you have more than one header in a column or more than one row header - i.e. you don't have unique fields to match. You might be tempted to do multiple index match formulas inside one another, or use an IF function here. The solution is actually quite simple. In the video I show you 3 different ways to write the INDEX MATCH formula in Excel. One method uses helper cells to create unique keys for the match function to find. Method 2, uses array formulas with CSE (Control Shift Enter) to convert the MATCH function to an array function. Method 3, avoids CSE and also avoids using helper cells in Excel. It does this by using a second INDEX formula inside the match function (INDEX does not require Control Shift Enter).

Complete Excel Dashboard course: https://courses.xelplus.com/p/professional-excel-dashboards Check out my other courses below. Download workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-index-and-match How to do Index Match in Excel: The basics. Watch this video tutorial to find out how you can use Index & Match for more complex lookup problems. This video shows you how Index Match works with simple and to the point explanation. It first shows you how Index works on it's own and then how Match works and then puts the two Excel functions together. Why index match is better than vlookup & why use index match instead of vlookup? Here are 3 reasons why Excel experts generally substitute VLOOKUP with INDEX and MATCH. 1. Unlike VLOOKUP, which searches only to the right, INDEX and MATCH can look in both directions – left and right. 2. INDEX & MATCH can perform two-way lookups by both looking along the rows and along the columns to find the intersection within a matrix. 3. INDEX & MATCH is less prone to errors. Assume you have a VLOOKUP where the final value you want returned is in column N. Your lookup value is in column A. You need to highlight the entire A to N range and then provide your index number to be 14. If you happen to delete any of the in-between columns, you would have to update that index number. You don’t need to worry about this when you use INDEX & MATCH. All in all, INDEX and MATCH is more flexible than VLOOKUP. Here are some of the reasons why Excel experts generally substitute VLOOKUP with INDEX and MATCH. Note: Index match is not case sensitive Index explained: The first argument of INDEX is to give it an array. This array (range) should include your answer. You then need to specify how many rows to go down and how many columns to move to find the correct value. You cannot move outside the INDEX range. The syntax of INDEX is: • The range where the return value resides. • Number of rows to move down (the row index) • Number of columns to move to the right (the column Index). This argument is optional. If you only have one column, you can leave the column argument empty, otherwise, you need to specify the number of columns to move over, in the range. The MATCH function’s syntax is as follows: • Like VLOOKUP, Match needs a lookup (target) value. The user can reference a cell or directly type the value into the formula. • Lookup_array: The “list” (range) where the return values are located. • Match_type: 0 for an “exact” match. Index MATCH used together: When INDEX and MATCH are used together, the MATCH function finds the look up value’s row / column index and then hands this value off to the INDEX function to get the lookup value. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 Time Stamps: 00:00 Is INDEX & MATCH the same as VLOOKUP? 00:52 Excel INDEX function explained 05:07 Excel MATCH function explained 06:29 Using INDEX & MATCH together 08:08 Two way lookup with INDEX & MATCH (data validation) 10:30 How to REALLY learn Excel INDEX & MATCH GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Download the free Excel Vlookup workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/basics-vlookup-hlookup/ Get the full course: https://courses.xelplus.com/ The Excel VLOOKUP formula can search for a specific category or value in an Excel data table and return the “opposing” value from adjacent columns. HLOOKUP function works exactly in the same way except that it looks horizontally rather than vertically. “V” in VLOOKUP refers to vertical and “H” in HLOOKUP refers to horizontal. If the data in your table has column headers, use the VLOOKUP function. If the data table has row headers and you need to search horizontally across the rows for a “match” then use HLOOKUP formula. Vlookup formulas do not need to have sorted lists. If your Excel table is unsorted make sure you look for an exact match by selecting "false" in the last argument of Vlookup. One major limitation of VLOOKUP is that it cannot look to the left. The values to lookup must always be on the left-most column of the range and the values to return must be on the right hand side. For two-way lookups - If you need to look up values across rows and also columns or multiple rows and columns the best function to use is the Index and Match function.

The link to the original report I mention in the video - https://business.udemy.com/blog/learning-predictions-2017/ This video shows you how to create special (non-standard) Excel graphs or info-charts in Excel. Not only that but it also shows you how you can conditionally format your graph to highlight specific categories. In this example, I show you how to highlight the week day that has the most users logged on to a system, but you can apply the same technique to any other logic as well. After that, I show you how you can add shapes to charts. This attracts the attention of your readers because it's different to what they are used to seeing. The problem with this technique is that it stretches out the shape for the bigger data sets so depending on the shape you are using, they are no longer harmonized. As a last step, I show you a trick you can use to create harmonized shapes in your Excel graphs. It's all a matter of proper data preparation before you draw out the chart. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Time Stamps 00:00 Why Create a Non-Standard Column Chart in Excel 01:48 Start with Basic Column Chart 02:44 Conditional Formatting of Excel Column Chart for MAX-Value 05:51 Create Round Shape for Excel Column Chart 07:45 Prevent Stretching of Round Shape in Column Chart 10:41 Add Data Labels to Excel Chart 12:45 Add Conditional Formatting to Rounded Column Chart Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Method 1: First method uses the SUMIFS formula with greater than and smaller than as criteria. Method 2: SUMPRODUCT formula works great here too as it can work well with exceptions (and condition) Method 3: The next method uses INDEX and Match function to find the category that coincides with the defined boundary values. Instead of looking for the exact match, we will use the option "less than" in the match type argument. Method 4: A fourth option that came to my mind when I was creating the thumbnail for the video was the LOOKUP formula: =LOOKUP(B2,$H$2:$H$7,$G$2:$G$7) Blogpost: http://www.xelplus.com/lookup-within-boundaries/ ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT11M40S	700	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZY-conYBbYc/maxresdefault.jpg	1	19758	373	2	0	54

Why? Because they allow you to easily add exceptions to your sum, average and count calculations. Don’t make your life more difficult by trying to use excel filters to get your sum. Use the SUMIFS formula instead. You can SUM based on multiple criteria. You can also use SUMIFS to sum if numbers are greater than a certain value. In this video I will show you a SUMIFS example and explanation. AVERAGEIFS works in the same way. COUNTIFS function is shorter than SUMIFS and AVERAGEIFS because it doesn’t need the additional sum range. It only needs the criteria range. It counts the number of times the criteria is met. Not sure if you should use SUMIF or SUMIFS? Stick to SUMIFS. This way you're on the safe side. In case you ever need to add more criteria, you can just expand on the arguments inside the formula. If you used SUMIF, you actually have to replace it with SUMIFS. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Time Stamps: 00:00 Why use Excel SUMIFS instead of SUMIF 01:20 Excel SUMIF function 03:10 Excel SUMIFS function 06:06 SUMIFS with wildcards 06:47 SUMIFS with comparison operators 09:17 Excel AVERAGIFS function 09:43 Excel COUNTIF function 10:19 Excel COUNTIFS function 11:50 How to use Excel Tables for dynamic referencing 13:31 Wrap Up Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

The end result is to come up with a description column in Excel, that includes the number of sub-items within a main item and also provides the description of the main item. This video builds on the existing video by providing an alternate method using the COUNTA, INDEX and MATCH functions. The formula shown here uses Excel's COUNTA function together with the INDEX function to create a dynamic range to count. The index function is used to provide a cell reference to the COUNTA function for the position of the top range as well as the position of the bottom range for each subset. Excel's match function is used to look for or match for the first non empty cell (non blank cell) to provide the location of the top cell address and then the match function is used again to match for the first empty cell to provide that address for the bottom of the range to the COUNTA function. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT16M55S	1015	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YBehCWjcizg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	23657	330	8	0	36

In the MMULT formula, I used the TRANSPOSE function to be able to dynamically add new columns to the original list. The problem with TRANSPOSE is that it requires Control shift Enter (CSE). In the best case, I'd rather have a formula that doesn't require CSE. In Part 3, I replace the TRANSPOSE part of the MMULT formula with alternate formulas. The idea is to use the ROW function, but somehow get the rows to be dependent on the columns. I first set out to use the ROW and INDIRECT functions. Then I use the ROW, INDIRECT and ADDRESS Function and finally I don't use INDIRECT at all, but instead the ROW and INDEX function (This one became my favorite). The great thing about the INDEX function is that it returns a cell reference instead of a cell value if you use it after the : sign in a formula. (INDEX is an amazing function!). Do look into it in more detail if you don't know it well. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT15M49S	949	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qd8vyLcpogw/maxresdefault.jpg	1	9234	117	2	0	26

In simple steps I explain how you can use MMULT to solve complex problems. Download the Workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-arrays-count-unique-items-with-mmult-function/ Visit Part 1 here: https://youtu.be/Nfu0fvbnccU And Part 3 here: https://youtu.be/qd8vyLcpogw In this example I use the MMULT formula to get the number of rows (workshops in this case) that contain at least one of the criteria (companies in this case). The analysis involves multiple criteria with an OR condition. I first explain the basics and the rules you need to follow to use the MMULT formula correctly. If you don't, you formula result will be #value. I then use the SUMPRODUCT, together with MMULT to get unique count by rows. To make it more dynamic, I use the COLUMN function together with TRANSPOSE. In the last video, I showed you how you can use helper cells first and then how to combine SUMPRODUCT with FREQUENCY function to get a one formula array solution. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT13M53S	833	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vC9S0oCa_Xk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	13215	140	1	0	24

In each of the videos of the series I use a different Excel array formula to get to the same result. In this video I show you how you can come up with an array formula that counts the rows if at least one of the lookup fields from the criteria list is in that row. It's an OR logical test involving multiple criteria. It shows a great use of the FREQUENCY function, the SUMPRODUCT formula and the ROW function. In addition to solving this problem, I take you through the steps you can take to break down complex array formulas and show you tricks you can use to "follow" your formulas' results which helps you come up with other functions that can help you get to your answer.

It explains the MOD function in simple terms and shows you three different practical cases. Excel MOD is shown as follows: 1. Grouping participants into groups of 6, 3 or 4. Which is better? i.e. has less people left over. 2. Reporting quarterly data 3. Controlling the occurrences of data labels in charts. For example, you have a line series and you'd like to show the data label for every 2nd, 3rd or 4th occurrence. Some details about MOD: What does the MOD function do? By definition, it returns the remainder after one number is divided by another. We can classify whole numbers into certain groups. For example, Odd and Even, or numbers that are divisible by two, by three, four, and so on. This is what the MOD function does. It checks if a number is divisible by another number and if not, how far away is it from being divisible. The key here, is that MOD looks backwards - i.e. to the next smaller number that was divisible and then count. MOD works the same with negative numbers. The video gives an example. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT19M30S	1170	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tLufL2M1TEs/maxresdefault.jpg	1	73297	1192	15	0	117

Blogpost: http://www.xelplus.com/sumproduct-year-to-date/ Get the full course: https://courses.xelplus.com/ Lecture Summary: In this video, I'll show you a way of writing YTD formulas (in this specific case for volume and price) when your data set goes over a few years. i.e. each month occurs more than once. If you were doing this manually, you'll need to revise your formula in the middle of your data set to make your range start from January of the next year. OFFSET allows you to create dynamic ranges - when you use this with the Month() and SUM() functions, you've created a smart formula that recognizes when the data goes over to the next year and revises your YTD calculation. Calculating, YTD price can be a bit trickier. To get the volume weighted average price, you need to multiply the volume by the price and add each month to the next up to the current month. Then divide that value by the YTD volume. This is when knowing how to use Excel's advanced formulas together can become helpful. Here the SUMPRODUCT function together with OFFSET can come to the rescue. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Download the Workbook here: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-offset-function-for-dynamic-calculations/ Get the full course: https://courses.xelplus.com/ Excel OFFSET Function Tutorial Summary: The offset formula looks like: =OFFSET(starting point, rows to move, columns to move, height, width) Here are practical uses of OFFSET: • Dynamic Calculations: The OFFSET formula can be included in other Excel functions to get dynamic ranges. For example, calculating the average sales of the last 3 months based on a selection • Flexible Chart Ranges: In conjunction with charts it can be used in the NAME manager to add flexibility to chart data. The OFFSET function behaves like an Excel table where the data range automatically expands and contracts when chart data is updated. • Dynamic dashboards: It can be used together with Excel’s Form Options to allow for dynamic analysis and reports based on user-selection. You can tell the OFFSET function to return one cell if you specify height and width as 1. It can return an array of cells when the height and width are greater than 1. Height and/or width CANNOT be zero, because you either need 1 cell or a range of cells. In the illustration above, the height and width are 2. This video shows how you can use the Excel OFFSET function to calculate the average value for the last 6 months. You will also learn how to use the OFFSET formula to calculate the average value based on the date selected by the user. (You will see formula combinations such as OFFSET, COUNTA and MATCH functions) In general Excel OFFSET function is an interesting formula and it’s one that can do so much more than meets the eye. It can used inside many formulas to provide them with flexible ranges instead of fixed ranges. This makes it a perfect candidate for dynamic reports and dashboards. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Ultimate Excel Waterfall Chart course summary: A waterfall or a bridge chart is a way of visualizing data that explains the movement from one balance to another balance. They are common in corporate reports – because they help to easily visualize the factors that are responsible for the change – for example how you got from gross sales to net income or how your profit developed from last year to this year. But they are also a good story teller for non-financial data. In this course you will learn to create different impressive variations of the waterfall from scratch. By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own customized variation of the waterfall chart which you can include in your corporate reports. You’re also going to learn a handful of useful tricks which you can use to create other amazing charts. Your colleagues and management will certainly be impressed. Here is an overview of the topics covered: - Shortcomings of Excel 2016 in-built Waterfall Chart - How to create the easiest Waterfall Chart EVER – (No stacked columns - works with negative values as well) - How to add sub-totals to the waterfall chart - Real business examples of Waterfall charts - How to overcome real-world issues such as - Long category labels on the horizontal axis - Adding dynamic connectors to improve readability - How to deal with very small delta values - Vertical Waterfall chart (bar version of the Waterfall) and creating them in impressive ways - Over 4 hours of Waterfall variations - Workbook included and Cheat sheets to be uploaded soon In this training I’m going to cover different alternatives for creating the waterfall chart. One alternative is obviously the new Excel 2016 standard waterfall, but as we dig deeper we will come across many limitations which will lead us to create it from scratch. That’s why you can take this course, no matter which Excel version you have. The target audience for this course is anyone who is interested in creating different variations of the waterfall in Excel. You might be a controller, financial analyst, someone responsible for creating corporate reports or you might just be interested to improve your Excel charting skills and want to learn advanced tricks to create impressive graphs.

The Waterfall chart is common in finance, but you can use it for any variable or statistic that goes through changes which can be positive or negative depending on the change. Where the waterfall is not so effective is when you have parts-to-whole relationships. (see this video for a better option: http://www.xelplus.com/use-this-instead-of-the-pie-chart/) For which cases is the waterfall chart good for? Two cases: 1. You need to explain a change that occurred from one time period to another. For example how did the earnings change (e.g. EBIT) from last year to this year and which factors where responsible for this change 2. You want to explain how you got from point A to point B within the same time period. For example how you went from gross sales to net income in the same month. The Waterfall is also not just financial figures. You can use it to explain changes in statistical data, for example changes in headcount – how many new employees were hired, how many resignations or retirements your company had during the year. One feature that makes the Waterfall a good story teller is the connectors. These connectors, connect the bars – the delta bars to one another – they have the effect of grouping the bars – which visually indicate that they belong together – they are all a part of the same story. In this video you will see a few different Waterfall charts used in the real business world. Each of these Waterfall charts were created in Excel. You can create these in ANY version of Excel you have. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Details: In this specific lecture I will give you an overview of the three important techniques used to generate this chart. The reason I call this the most flexible waterfall chart is because you have control over a lot of features that you don’t have control over if you use the new Excel 2016 waterfall chart. For example, you can change the color of the delta bars to whichever color you like, independent of the color scheme. – You can decide where you want to have the data labels, you can include new data series to add your own customization. It also has no problem to show values that go below the horizontal axis, i.e. if you have negative cumulative values. The data preparation table is also quite simple. This technique does not use the general stacked column chart with invisible base approach, instead it uses error bars and up/down bars to get a very flexible, yet simple waterfall graph. If you’re interested to learn more about the different ways you can use error bars, up/down bars, how to fully control your data labels or even your series labels - and other tricks and techniques in charts, I recommend you take a look at my online excel visualization/chart course. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Details: A waterfall chart or a bridge chart is a way of visualizing your data that helps you understand how you got from one balance to another balance. They are common for financial figures – they allow you to see the profit development – how to you get from gross sales to net income or how your EBIT or earnings developed from last year to this year. But they are also a good story teller for non-financial data. The waterfall chart is also a very liked chart by management. For good reason too. It’s a neat way of presenting your data and explaining the story. But it’s a very difficult chart for people create and maintain. It’s one of the most common charts for which people use additional third-party add-ins for. That was the reason Excel 2016 introduced a built-in waterfall. Extremely user-friendly but not flexible. Same problem you have with many add-ins. Hence the reason for this course. Microsoft Excel 2016 came with a built-in waterfall chart. It made a lot of people happy because it made their life simpler. I was super excited when I heard about it and really impressed how simple it is to create a chart. But then when I started to make adjustments to the chart I realized it’s not that flexible. Basically ease of use came at the cost of flexibility. In this lecture I’m going to show you how to use the Excel 2016 standard waterfall chart. How simple and great it is. I am also gonna go through it’s restrictions and why I still prefer to create the waterfall chart from scratch. Even in Excel 2016. It obviously involves more steps but it comes with great flexibility. The advantages of the Excel 2016 waterfall chart are: Very Easy to Create the new Excel 2016 Waterfall Does not require any special data preparation The disadvantages of Excel 2016 Waterfall Graph are: Chart title cannot reference cells - formula can't be used here Colors can only be controlled via global color scheme Waterfall Connector color cannot be adjusted Data Label position is restricted (not possible to have negative data labels to show above) No other series can be added to the chart - not visible Incorrect display of values in Waterfall when in the negative vertical axis (below horizontal axis) Not all chart functionalities are available Only compatible for anyone using Excel 2016 ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Follow these best practices for optimum data table design in Excel: 1. Organize – arrange your categories into groups whenever it makes sense. Items should have a clear sequence. If you're not sure, put yourself in your readers shoes. If you have ratios presented, these should come right after your variables that feed the ratio. If you are showing aggregated values, you should visually separate this from the rest of the data by either adding borders or color to distinguish it from the rest. 2. Focus on data – Keep the focus on your data by keeping the table borders and grids very subtle. Or simply use white space for the grids between data. Use very subtle fill color to assist the reader with horizontal scanning of values for larger data tables. 3. Formatting – Numbers should be right aligned. This way the reader can compare the values with more ease than when they are centered or left aligned. Text on the other hand should generally be left-aligned. Sometimes though when the text is short, you might prefer to center or right align it to fit your table better – so use your judgment here. How you present large numbers, negative and positive values really depend on your country and the organization you work for – i.e. what your readers are used to seeing. Text font should be easy to read, such as Arial or Verdana. 4. Emphasis – If you’d like to bring the readers attention to a certain number, you can use color or change it’s format to bold. If you’d like to bring the attention to a certain section of the table, especially when doing comparisons between one scenario to another, such as budget against actual, you can use symbols.

Check the course landing page for more info. If you'd like to learn the newest version of this feature check out Power Query. Excel has various tools that can help you easily clean up your raw data for further analysis. Apart from using formulas and formatting, there are two useful Excel features that let you easily clean up. One method is text to columns feature and the other to import external data. The Get External Data tool can be used to import and analyse data from other systems. This tool is also useful for importing data to run your dashboards or do further analysis using pivot tables, etc. Usually you can get data extracts from any system (e.g. “.dat” or “.csv” from Oracle, “.xml” files from SAP, etc.). These can be imported into Excel. Importing External Data also gives you control over the decimals and thousand separator, especially if you’re dealing with international companies. In the US, the decimal is dot and the comma is a thousand separator and in most European countries it’s the other way round, where the comma is a decimal and the dot a thousand separator. It’s always safest to Import it properly with the Excel Data Import wizard! After importing press Ctrl + T to create a table out of it. You can create a pivot table off this one, and when you do, even if you add more data to it, the pivot reflects the new data. Importing Data from the Web / Internet into Excel – creating web queries that refresh automatically: In Excel you can also import data directly from the web. You basically create a web query which you set to refresh automatically based on your preference. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

You have mistakes in your formulas but because they are too long and complex you can’t find where the problem is 2. The result of your formula throws an error for some cells and you’re not sure why. In this video I will give you a tour of the formula audit tools that are available and how they can help you track and debug your formulas. You will also find out how you can use the "watch window" to keep you eyes on the value of certain cells while you adjust your input values elsewhere. This feature can come in really handy and avoids you having to jump between different Excel tabs and workbooks. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT8M42S	522	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjGv2_fZb7Y/maxresdefault.jpg	1	26260	489	5	0	34

It would create a color collage and take too much energy from your readers to try to understand the message. What you can do is create what looks like multiple charts and show them horizontally. You can also create chart matrices. Just make sure that you are consistent by using a common axis, size, color, font, spacing etc. Each Excel chart should look like the identical twin of the other, except that it will show a different series or variable. In the example in the video, we have four companies and we’d like to compare the actual profit and the budgeted profit for each company, against one another. We can do this best by showing them as a panel chart. Because the companies are right beside one another and they share a common axis it is very easy to compare. Sequencing is also an important parameter to consider when designing panel charts. If you have a specific sequence in the organization that you’d like to keep, you might want to keep that order. However, if that doesn’t apply you can also consider sequencing your charts in ascending or descending order based on the total yearly profit. It really depends on your audience and your message. To design your panel charts as one chart you will need to have your data in a specific order. It's actually quite easy.

Download the workbook: http://www.xelplus.com/excel-sumproduct-formula-easy-explanation/ Get the full course: https://courses.xelplus.com Advanced Excel: Master Excel's SUMPRODUCT Formula This video is part of a series that belongs to my Advanced Training course called "Advanced Excel: Top tips and formulas". The classical use of Excel's SUMPRODUCT function is to do a sum of multiplications. The good thing about SUMPRODUCT is that it can work on arrays of values and it doesn’t have to be entered as an array function so no need to do control + shift + enter (CSE). The great thing about SUMPRODUCT, is that it can help solve many more problems in non-obvious ways. It can act as a conditional SUMIFS function or work as a lookup function as INDEX and MATCH does. It can also act as a COUNTIF function. SUMPRODUCT is also a better SUMIFS, because it can check for OR conditions - which the SUMIFS can't. SUMIFS can only check for AND conditions. In this video you will see different examples of the SUMPRODUCT function and you will learn how it can save you from unnecessary "workarounds" in your Excel files. It will also show you the SUMPRODUCT formula in slow motion. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://www.xelplus.com/courses/ ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Microphone: https://amzn.to/2DVKstA Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Let’s connect on social: Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lgharani Twitter: https://twitter.com/leilagharani LinkedIn: https://at.linkedin.com/in/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

Only when you know the extent and possibilities Excel offers you, only then are you able to handle any type of analysis with the best method. Advanced Excel skills are highly relevant in business. No matter which role you’re currently in or you’re planning to take on. Whether you’ll be in Finance, consulting, IT, in project management, your advanced Excel skills will set you apart from the competition. What is the difference between an Advanced and Average Excel user? An advanced Excel user is aware of the tools and features available and can apply the right tools for the right task, instead of relying on their go-to tools and making them work for every situation. Advanced users, always find the optimal solution for every task, and they find it fast! What differentiates this Excel course from others? The reason I created this course is because there are many advanced Excel users who are unaware key features & formulas in Excel. I understand that when you take an Excel training it can be so broad, and a lot of courses cover too many topics. It’s easy to get lost. You might also not immediately appreciate why some features are useful and how you can practically apply them. We are creatures of habit and it’s difficult to get our head around learning new techniques. As a result you might be missing out on some features that can majorly simplify the way you use Excel. Differentiation factor #1 Focus - The top 10 brings focus to the key Excel features which will provide you with a solid & a strong foundation in Excel. Differentiation factor #2 Learn by doing - The course is well structured and organized. You can download my Demo workbook which I use to demonstrate each feature and practice along with me. You can then do an exercise from the Exercise workbook to test your knowledge. Real learning happens when you attempt to solve problems on your own. Answers are provided, but do ask any questions if you get stuck. Your questions will always be answered. Differentiation factor #3 Engaging - I have made every attempt to keep the course interesting and engaging by mixing talking head explanations with screencast demos. Each course is split by topic & feature. This allows you to easily pick what you want to learn now or review later. Summary My main goal in this training is to increase your awareness of the top tools and formulas in Excel to help you solve complex problems. Users are not aware of what they don’t know. Only when you know the extent and possibilities Excel offers you, only then are you able to handle any type of analysis with the best method. Becoming advanced takes practice, readiness to learn new methods and willingness to apply these to practical cases. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/ Get Office 365: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/15OEg Microsoft Surface: https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/c/1327040/451518/7593 GEAR Screen recorder: http://techsmith.pxf.io/c/1252781/347799/5161 Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3a5ldBs Backup Camera: https://amzn.to/2FLiFho Main Lens: https://amzn.to/39apgeD Zoom Lens: https://amzn.to/3bd5pN7 Audio Recorder: https://amzn.to/2Uo5rLm Microphone: https://amzn.to/2xYy9em Lights: http://amzn.to/2eJKg1U More resources on my Amazon page: https://www.amazon.com/shop/leilagharani Note: This description contains affiliate links, which means at no additional cost to you, we will receive a small commission if you make a purchase using the links.

How to visualize your data for a clear message? Not sure what is easy, effective and possible in Excel? Learn all of this and more at your own pace with my online training. In this lecture I provide an overview of what makes a chart effective – by effective I mean the reader is able to clearly understand the message that you are trying to communicate - Charts should be "SCC" - Simple, Clear & consistent. Detail: Now lets have a look at each parameter for Simple, Clear & Consistent For Simple: - Strip your Chart: take away components, colors, images and anything else that does not matter a. Take away background color b. Lighten the grid lines or take them away entirely c. You can remove the Y axis if you show data labels or only show beginning & end values - Stick to simple fonts. They shouldn’t be too small and difficult to read - Stick to 2D For clear: As noted by Edward Tufte “Above all else show the data”. In his book the Visual Display of Quantitative information he talks about the concept of the data-ink ratio. Data-ink ratio is the amount of ink that shows the information as compared to the total amount of ink. Basically what it comes down to is don’t waste ink on things that don’t matter. Use your ink to show and highlight what matters. The way you highlight, is either you reduce the ink from the surroundings, or you increase the ink of the element you like to highlight. Simplified charts ensure your attention is driven to the data: to what matters. - Have a title – Every chart should have a title. Your readers shouldn’t have to figure it out. The title should be on top of the Chart. Reports are read from top to bottom and in the western world from left to right. The top left corner has a great impact but up middle is also good. - Tell the story – the truth and nothing but the truth. Don’t have breaks in the axis such as a gap between the values – i.e. have consistent scaling. Start form zero. Sometimes you want to concentrate attention to the pattern of a section of the graph and you might not do your story justice if you start from zero. In this case you can add a second graph where the y axis doesn’t start from zero. If you do start your axis other than zero, make sure you inform the readers. If you are using a column chart though, always start from zero. -If you have more than one series you need legends. These are your series labels. Whenever you can – such as for line graphs, place the legends by the series. If you can't place it by the series, then place them either on top, below the title or on the right hand-side. - Boost elements: do emphasize the most important part if there is a certain point you want to make and you want your readers to find it fast. Consistent: Use the same colors throughout your reports. Actual series should always stand out and have a consistent color throughout the report. Keep consistent colors for Budget and Outlook series. The colors that work well are different shades of grey & blue. It also depends on the logo and color mix of your organization. If your organization has a brown logo, you might want to use a shade of Brown for Actual series, if it is blue, then blue might work better. Whatever color you choose, you should stick with it throughout your report. That’s SCC - Simple, Clear & consistent. Every time you design a chart, make sure it’s as SCC as it can get. Then go beyond SCC and ensure it is as dynamic as it can get.

Not sure which charts & methods to use to show performance and variances? This lecture will provide you with some examples that are covered in my Excel online visualization course. Summary: This lecture provides you with an overview of different methods used for visualizing performance comparisons, deviations, as well as future estimated performance. It introduces you to the topics and charts that you will learn in this section as well as the next two sections. This is specially beneficial for controllers and financial analysts looking to enhance their corporate reports to include better & improved charts. Detail: In every corporate report, you have sections where you make comparison of actual values to budget or target values. In this section I will show you the most effective ways of making these comparisons. You will also compare your performance to PY to see if you did better or worse. There are different way of doing this. My favorites are using symbols and using what I call the pin chart. I will show you these in the next section. Lastly you will also have reports where you show how you expect to be performing for the rest of the year. These are called your forecasts or outlooks. I will show you some methods of displaying these effectively in Excel in the section after next. One point to emphasize is the consistent use of colors in your reports. Make sure your actuals have the same colour throughout your reports. They should be clearly in focus and visible. Basically stand out against budget, target, previous year, forecasts and any other series you have. In the same manner, be consistent with the use of color for your other series. ★ My Online Excel Courses ► https://courses.xelplus.com ✉ Subscribe & get my TOP 10 Excel formulas e-book for free https://www.xelplus.com/free-ebook/ EXCEL RESOURCES I Recommend: https://www.xelplus.com/resources/	27	Education	PT2M36S	156	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPxCKs4OlWE/maxresdefault.jpg	1	57008	290	36	0	11
