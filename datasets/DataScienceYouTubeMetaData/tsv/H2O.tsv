One of the main goals of an AutoML tool is to train the “best” model possible in the least amount of computation time, with zero/minimal configuration by the user. AutoML tools reduce the expertise required for practitioners to train powerful machine learning models, which has expanded and accelerated the application of machine learning to problems in both academic research and industry. AutoML greatly speeds up the workflow and efficiency of even the most experienced data scientist. As automation and use of machine learning increases, in particular with the proliferation of open source AutoML tools, there’s an increased risk in misuse of, or harm by, machine learning models used in real world applications. In order to reduce the risk of harmful models being deployed, machine learning tools, and especially AutoML tools, can offer easy-to-use or automated interpretability and algorithmic fairness methods that can be used to evaluate and probe machine learning models. Interpretability and fairness methods should always be applied to machine learning models before they are deployed into production where they can make or influence important decisions affecting people’s lives. In this session, you will learn about: - Automated Machine Learning and open source H2O AutoML - Interpretability methods for H2O models - Algorithmic fairness (disparate impact) for H2O models - Demo using U.S. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data Presenter: Erin LeDell, Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai	28	Science & Technology	PT59M53S	3593	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hk5WEPNEA_w/maxresdefault.jpg		199			0	1

In order to provide explainable results for their models, data scientists and statisticians in both industries relied heavily on generalized linear models (GLMs). However, new machine learning algorithms like GBMs are not only more sophisticated estimators of risk, but due to a Nobel-laureate breakthrough known as Shapley values, they are now seemingly just as interpretable as traditional GLMs. More nuanced risk estimation means less payouts and write-offs for policy and credit issuers, but it also means a broader group of customers can participate in mainstream insurance and credit markets. In this webinar, you will learn about: - The Advantages of Machine Learning vs. Linear Models - Why you should think about the AI shift in perspective - How to move to new ML Methods (e.g. GBM) Presenters: Patrick Hall, Advisory Consultant at H2O.ai Michael Proksch, Senior Director, Customer Data Science at H2O.ai	28	Science & Technology	PT1H56S	56	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLxR5fqVQm0/maxresdefault.jpg		345			0	3

For others, model documentation is part of a data science team’s best practices. Model documentation includes how a model was created, training and test data characteristics, what alternatives were considered, how the model was evaluated, and information on model performance. Collecting and documenting this information can take a data scientist days to complete for each model. The model document needs to be comprehensive and consistent across various projects. The process of creating this documentation is tedious for the data scientist and wasteful for the business because the data scientist could be using that time to build additional models and create more value. Inconsistent or inaccurate model documentation can be an issue for model validation, governance, and regulatory compliance. This virtual meetup shows how to automate the creation of comprehensive, high-quality model documentation that saves time, increases productivity, and improves model governance.	28	Science & Technology	PT41M18S	2478	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngLnM8nUrhU/maxresdefault.jpg		57			0	0

To learn more about H2O AutoDoc, visit: https://www.h2o.ai/resources/product-brief/h2o-in-autodoc/ Slides from the session are available here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/automatic-model-documentation-with-h2o For many companies, model documentation is a requirement for any model to be used in the business. For other companies, model documentation is part of a data science team’s best practices. Model documentation includes how a model was created, training and test data characteristics, what alternatives were considered, how the model was evaluated, and information on model performance. Collecting and documenting this information can take a data scientist days to complete for each model. The model document needs to be comprehensive and consistent across various projects. The process of creating this documentation is tedious for the data scientist and wasteful for the business because the data scientist could be using that time to build additional models and create more value. Inconsistent or inaccurate model documentation can be an issue for model validation, governance, and regulatory compliance. In this virtual meetup, we will learn how to create comprehensive, high-quality model documentation in minutes that saves time, increases productivity and improves model governance.

Description: H2O datatable is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data structures, aka data frames. It is close in spirit to pandas, however, we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the package is closely related to R's data.table and attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API. H2O datatable started in 2017 as a toolkit for performing big data operations on a single-node machine, at the maximum speed possible. Such requirements are dictated by modern machine-learning applications, such as H2O Driverless AI, which need to process large volumes of data and generate many features in order to achieve the best model accuracy. In the talk we will introduce H2O datatable, focusing on its data munging and modeling capabilities, followed by the Q/A session. Speaker Bio: Oleksiy Kononenko: Oleksiy is a maker scientist and hacker at H2O.ai, focusing on highly optimized algorithms for machine learning and data analysis. He holds M.S., summa cum laude, and Ph.D. degrees in applied mathematics from National University of Kharkiv, Ukraine. In 2009, Oleksiy was selected as a research fellow by CERN and contributed to R&D for Large Hadron Collider and next generation of high energy particle accelerators. In 2013 he joined SLAC and Stanford University to develop high performance simulation suite for 3D multi-physics modeling. Oleksiy authored more than 60 scientific papers, was an invited speaker at major international conferences, prominent institutions and companies worldwide.

FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) in contrast to Word2vec model accounts for sub-word information by also embedding sub-word n-grams. FastText word representation is the word embedding vector plus the sum of n-grams contained in it. Word2vec vector norms have been shown (Schakel & Wilson, 2015) to be correlated to word significance. This talk discusses the visualization of vector norms of FastText embeddings and evaluates the use of FastText word vector norm multiplied with the number of word n-grams for detecting non-English OOV words.

Talk 1: Scalable Automatic Machine Learning in H2O by Erin LeDell The focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning using the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open-source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data. The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide an overview of the methodology behind H2O's AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface that automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a "leaderboard" of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production. R and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples are available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops. About Erin: Erin LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open-source, distributed machine learning platform, H2O. At H2O.ai, she leads the H2O AutoML project and her current research focus is automated machine learning. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io (acquired by GE) and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode), the founder of DataScientific, Inc. and a software engineer. She is also the founder of the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) organization (wimlds.org) and co-founder of R-Ladies Global (rladies.org). Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley and has a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics. Talk 2: Off-Policy Partial Feedback System Reward Estimation in Seznam.cz Web Search Engine by Pavel Prochazka The talk will be about the off-policy evaluation of the contextual multi-armed bandit applied to the vertical search blending problem in Seznam.cz web search engine. We highlight the advantages of the counterfactual off-policy evaluation approach over conventional online A/B testing and introduce basic counterfactual methods such as inverse propensity score (IPS) reward estimator. The counterfactual approach requires properly evaluated propensities for valid off-policy evaluation. The IPS estimate quality (its variance) depends on particular propensity values that are directly related to logging policy exploration. About Pavel: Pavel Prochazka is a research engineer at Seznam.cz. He focuses on information retrieval related research applications into Seznam.cz web search engine. In particular, his interests include mainly learning to rank, counterfactual analysis and query understanding. Pavel received his Ph.D. in wireless communications from the Czech Technical University in Prague, where the main research focus was on iterative detection and Bayesian inference in wireless communication systems. https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-prochazka-4725b852/	28	Science & Technology	PT1H59M50S	3590	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHBd8kvh3cA/maxresdefault.jpg		342			0	1

Understanding text that appears on images in social media platforms is important not just for improving experiences such as the incorporation of text into screen readers for the visually impaired, but they also help keep the community safe by proactively identify inappropriate or harmful content in a way that pure object detection or NLP systems alone cannot. This talk describes the challenges behind building an industry-scale scene-text extraction system at Facebook that processes over 2 billion images each day. I'll cover the Deep Learning methods behind building models that perform detection of text in arbitrary orientations with high-accuracy, and how simple convolutional models work extremely well for recognizing text in over 50 languages. A critical aspect of the work is scaling up these models for efficient server-side inference. I'll dive into quantization methods to run neural networks with 8-bit integer weights and activations instead of 32-bit floating points, and the challenges involved in bridging the accuracy gap. https://engineering.fb.com/ai-research/rosetta-understanding-text-in-images-and-videos-with-machine-learning/ About Viswanath: Researcher at Facebook AI Research https://research.fb.com/people/sivakumar-viswanath/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/viswanath-sivakumar-56b76318/ To view more details and to join our meetup community, visit here: https://www.meetup.com/London-Artificial-Intelligence-Deep-Learning/events/264781194/	28	Science & Technology	PT29M13S	1753	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8COSk3LgNQ/maxresdefault.jpg		114			0	0

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rKtZXYm0P1NsfM The Grammar of Graphics and the Future of Big Data Visualization This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the first edition of The Grammar of Graphics (GG). The book laid the foundation for a major visualization component at the statistical software company SPSS. Since that edition, a commercial company, Tableau, evolved from a Stanford seminar and dissertation devoted to the book. Not long after, the widely used open-source visualization package, ggplot2, arose from a dissertation at Iowa State University. GG not only provided for the first time a formal mathematical foundation for generating statistical charts, but also introduced a wider range of graphics than seen in previous graphical systems. This talk will briefly review that history and then outline recent efforts at H2O to apply GG to very large datasets where classical rendering and analytic methods are infeasible. Bio: Leland Wilkinson is Chief Scientist at H2O and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. He received an A.B. degree from Harvard in 1966, an S.T.B. degree from Harvard Divinity School in 1969, and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1975. Wilkinson wrote the SYSTAT statistical package and founded SYSTAT Inc. in 1984. After the company grew to 50 employees, he sold SYSTAT to SPSS in 1994 and worked there for ten years on research and development of visualization systems. Wilkinson subsequently worked at Skytree and Tableau before joining H2O. Wilkinson is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, an elected member of the International Statistical Institute, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has won best speaker award at the National Computer Graphics Association and the Youden prize for best expository paper in the statistics journal Technometrics. He has served on the Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics of the National Research Council and is a member of the Boards of the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) and the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM).

Slides from the session can be viewed here: David Eisenbud: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/constantinos-daskalakis-mit-david-eisenbud-msri-reducing-ai-bias-using-truncated-statistics-h2o-world-2019-nyc-185436793/0xdata/constantinos-daskalakis-mit-david-eisenbud-msri-reducing-ai-bias-using-truncated-statistics-h2o-world-2019-nyc-185436793 Reducing AI Bias Using Truncated Statistics An emergent threat to the practical use of machine learning is the presence of bias in the data used to train models. Biased training data can result in models which make incorrect or disproportionately correct decisions, or that reinforce the injustices reflected in their training data. For example, recent works have shown that semantics derived automatically from text corpora contain human biases, and found that the accuracy of face and gender recognition systems are systematically lower for people of color and women. While the root causes of AI bias are difficult to pin down, a common cause of bias is the violation of the pervasive assumption that the data used to train models are unbiased samples of an underlying “test distribution,” which represents the conditions that the trained model will encounter in the future. Overcoming the bias introduced by the discrepancy between train and test distributions has been the focus of a long line of research in truncated Statistics. We provide computationally and statistically efficient algorithms for truncated density estimation and truncated linear, logistic and probit regression in high dimensions, through a general, practical framework based on Stochastic Gradient Descent. We illustrate the efficacy of our framework through several experiments. Bio: David Eisenbud served as Director of MSRI from 1997 to 2007, and began a new term in 2013.

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2gs0SUgbuTMf4I The Case for Model Debugging Prediction by machine learning models is fundamentally the execution of computer code. Like all good code, machine learning models should be debugged for logical or runtime errors or for security vulnerabilities. Recent, high-profile failures have made it clear that machine learning models must also be debugged for disparate impact across demographic segments and other types of sociological bias. Model debugging enhances trust in machine learning directly by increasing accuracy in new or holdout data, by decreasing or identifying hackable attack surfaces, or by decreasing sociological bias. As a side-effect, model debugging should also increase understanding and explainability of model mechanisms and predictions. This presentation outlines several standard and newer model debugging techniques and proposes several potential remediation methods for any discovered bugs. Discussed debugging techniques include adversarial examples, benchmark models, partial dependence and individual conditional expectation, random attacks, Shapley explanations of predictions and residuals, and models of residuals. Proposed remediation approaches include alternate models, editing of deployable model artifacts, missing value injection, prediction assertions, and regularization methods.

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2InRHRvc7bB2Qs Responsible Data Science: Identifying and Fixing Biased AI Numerous stories in the press have shown that machine learning has the potential to be unfair and even discriminatory. As a result, the public, regulators, and legislators are taking a hard look at AI; if your models are used for high-stakes decision making, then you will need to be able to convince these groups that your models are not discriminatory. To do this, you need to know how to assess models for evidence of discrimination and then be able to fix any problems you may find. In this talk, Nick will outline what is required for a model to be fair, discuss how different types of discrimination might make their way into a model, and then explain the algorithms and techniques that can be used to make AI fairer. Bio: Nicholas Schmidt is a partner at BLDS, LLC, and heads the Artificial Intelligence Practice. In these roles, Nick specializes in the application of statistics and economics to questions of law, regulatory compliance, and best practices in model governance. As head of the A.I. practice, Nick develops and assists in the deployment of methods that allow his clients to make their A.I. models fairer and more inclusive. In this work, he has created A.I.-based techniques that enable clients to minimize disparate impact in credit, insurance, and marketing models. He has additionally helped his clients understand and implement methods that open “black-box” A.I. models, enabling a clearer understanding A.I.’s decision-making process. His clients use this work to inform their customers on potential denials of credit (“adverse action notices”). These methods are used in a number of the top-10 U.S. retail banks and FinTechs. In his litigation practice, Nick testifies and consults on matters relating to employment discrimination litigation, wage and hour law, and other matters requiring the utilization of statistics to address questions of liability or damages. Nick holds an MBA in economics and econometrics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.	28	Science & Technology	PT24M	1440	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rToFuhI6Nlw/maxresdefault.jpg		200			0	0

It affects governments, societies, and legitimate trade. It supports nefarious activities, such as terrorism, human trafficking, illegal trade, and not the least of all, financial stability of a country. The current tools of AML are plagued by high false positives, they involve manual processes which are prone to subjective assessment, and all of this can delay in aiding criminal evasion. In this webinar, we will showcase what we are doing to reduce the false positives, modify the process more objectively and try to assess alerts at line speed. What we build is a mix of ones’ knowledge and artificial intelligence. We will also talk about how you can take advantage of the tools to build basic blocks of a model and then use H2O Driverless AI to build a strong model.

As Forrester pointed out, these tools are trying to automate the end-to-end life cycle of developing and deploying predictive models — from data prep through feature engineering, model training, validation and deployment. This often involves evaluating numerous platforms and identifying the best fit for their organization. The decision process is based on multiple considerations, including accuracy, ease-of-use, performance, integration with existing tools, economics, competitive differentiation, solution maturity, risk tolerance, regulatory compliance considerations and more. Tune into this webinar to learn about the top 5 considerations in selecting an AutoML platform. Vinod is joined by one of H2O.ai's Kaggle Grandmasters, Bojan Tunguz, for the discussion.

It is close in spirit to pandas, however, we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the package is closely related to R's data.table and attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API. H2O datatable started in 2017 as a toolkit for performing big data operations on a single-node machine, at the maximum speed possible. Such requirements are dictated by modern machine-learning applications, such as H2O Driverless AI, which need to process large volumes of data and generate many features in order to achieve the best model accuracy. In the talk we will introduce H2O datatable, focusing on its data munging and modeling capabilities, followed by the Q/A session. Speaker Bios: Pasha Stetsenko: Pasha is a Hacker Scientist at H2O.ai. He holds an MS in Applied Physics and Mathematics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, an MA in Economics from New Economic School (Moscow), and a PhD in Economics (econometrics) from Stanford University.

Productionizing H2O Models with Apache Spark ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Spark pipelines represent a powerful concept to support productionizing machine learning workflows. Their API allows to combine data processing with machine learning algorithms and opens opportunities for integration with various machine learning libraries. However, to benefit from the power of pipelines, their users need to have the freedom to choose and experiment with any machine learning algorithm or library. Therefore, we developed Sparkling Water that embeds H2O machine learning library of advanced algorithms into the Spark ecosystem and exposes them via pipeline API. Furthermore, the algorithms benefit from H2O MOJOs - Model Object Optimized - a powerful concept shared across entire H2O platform to store and exchange models. The MOJOs are designed for effective model deployment with a focus on scoring speed, traceability, exchangeability, and backward compatibility. In this talk, we will explain the architecture of Sparkling Water with focus on integration into the Spark pipelines and MOJOs. We’ll demonstrate the creation of pipelines integrating H2O machine learning models and their deployments using Scala or Python. Furthermore, we will show how to utilize a pre-trained model MOJOs with Spark pipelines. Speaker’s Bio: A Software Engineer, Edgar studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Before H2O, Edgar was a Lead Software Engineer building high-performance microservices in Scala. He engineered data pipelines at Hortonworks and was the architect of the company's new generation of data platform environments for the desktop. When not glued to one of his machines, he can be found volunteering, playing board games or D&D, or on a mission to find the best nachos in town.	28	Science & Technology	PT47M44S	2864	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ObcQQITVQg/maxresdefault.jpg		409			0	0

Description: The conceptual workflow of applying machine learning (ML) to any specific use case is simple: at the training phase, the learning component takes a dataset as input and builds a learned model; at the serving phase, the model takes features as input and yields predictions. However, the actual workflow becomes more complex when ML models need to be set up in a production environment. This will require a careful orchestration of several components to reliably produce, deploy and evaluate such models. At Groupon, the ranking recommendation system is based on supervised ML models. Once a model is promoted from candidate to released, and start serving real-time traffic, it opens the following questions: How can we assure that the model is not losing its prediction power? How can we reliably keep track of all released models life cycle? To answer these questions, each new model is built on an ML pipeline that guarantees its standardization, transparency, reproducibility and reliable evaluation. For this purpose, at Groupon we built a custom made ML-pipeline, using a simple but powerful integration between MLFow and H2O sparkling water. Every model during its training step publishes all its information, such as output values, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, features, queries, etcetera, into MLflow as the main Model Registry. As a final step of the ML Pipeline, every released model is evaluated with fresh data, by applying a sequence of orchestrated steps. Each released model retrieves its metadata from MLflow and is evaluated by using the same constraints over the data, so as to assure a reliable evaluation. Finally, the variations on the predictive power of the model are visualized using Kibana, to constantly monitor any sign of decay.

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/keynote-tanya-berger-wolf-dan-rubenstein-wildbook-ai-and-humans-combatting-extinction Abstract: Photographs, taken by field scientists, tourists, automated cameras, and incidental photographers, are the most abundant source of data on wildlife today. Wildbook, a project of tech for conservation non-profit Wild Me, is an autonomous computational system that starts from massive collections of images and, by detecting various species of animals and identifying individuals, combined with sophisticated data management, turns them into high resolution information database, enabling scientific inquiry, conservation, and citizen science. We have built Wildbooks for over 20 species of animals, including whales (flukebook.org), sharks (whaleshark.org), giraffes (giraffespotter.org), and, with H2O.ai's help, working on elephants. In January 2016, Wildbook enabled the first ever full species (the endangered Grevy's zebra) census using photographs taken by ordinary citizens in Kenya.The resulting numbers are now the official species census used by IUCN Red List and we repeated the effort in 2018, becoming the first certified census from an outside organization accepted by the Kenyan government. Wildbook is becoming the data foundation for wildlife science, conservation, and policy.

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/alvaro-viloria-groupon-productionalizing-ml-at-scale-with-mlflow-and-h2o-sparkling-water-h2o-world-san-francisco Description: The conceptual workflow of applying machine learning (ML) to any specific use case is simple: at the training phase, the learning component takes a dataset as input and builds a learned model; at the serving phase, the model takes features as input and yields predictions. However, the actual workflow becomes more complex when ML models need to be set up in a production environment. This will require a careful orchestration of several components to reliably produce, deploy and evaluate such models. At Groupon, the ranking recommendation system is based on supervised ML models. Once a model is promoted from candidate to released, and start serving real-time traffic, it opens the following questions: How can we assure that the model is not losing its prediction power? How can we reliably keep track of all released models life cycle? To answer these questions, each new model is built on an ML pipeline that guarantees its standardization, transparency, reproducibility and reliable evaluation. For this purpose, at Groupon we built a custom made ML-pipeline, using a simple but powerful integration between MLFow and H2O sparkling water. Every model during its training step publishes all its information, such as output values, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, features, queries, etcetera, into MLflow as the main Model Registry. As a final step of the ML Pipeline, every released model is evaluated with fresh data, by applying a sequence of orchestrated steps. Each released model retrieves its metadata from MLflow and is evaluated by using the same constraints over the data, so as to assure a reliable evaluation. Finally, the variations on the predictive power of the model are visualized using Kibana, to constantly monitor any sign of decay.	28	Science & Technology	PT23M40S	1420	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPzKY6TEMOk/maxresdefault.jpg		552			0	0

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/mara-averick-rstudio-sustainers-of-the-tidyverse-h2o-world Description: If a piece of open-source software is to survive its own success, it must have a healthy community of active contributors. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science with a shared underlying design philosophy, has become popular in no small part because of its usability among those who do not consider themselves to be “programmers.” However, this active base of non-developer users has been a fruitful source of contributions as we’ve sought to highlight aspects of contributing to open source beyond committing lines of code. This talk will cover the technical tools, virtual spaces, and social norms that have enabled and empowered community contributions. Mara Averick is the tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio. She got into R by way of a long-time love for the NBA and (fantasy) basketball. When not catering to the every whim of her dogs, she can be found: perusing weird words; indulging her bibliomania; and/or watching, quantifying, and visualizing Archer.	28	Science & Technology	PT23M35S	1415	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2k4koLq8w1w/maxresdefault.jpg		578			0	0

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/tess-posner-ai4all-diverse-and-inclusive-ai Artificial intelligence could contribute an additional 1.2% to annual gross domestic product growth over the next decade, according to a recent McKinsey report. The report also predicts that about 70% of companies will adopt at least one form of AI by 2030. As AI goes full steam ahead, it's critical to ask the right questions while still in early stages: who is building and shaping this important technology? Research shows that the AI field doesn’t adequately reflect the broader population, which suggests that globally, we’re missing out on the value that diverse teams bring to AI development, implementation, and research. For example, in the US only 13% of AI CEOs are women, and only 2.6% of tenure-track engineering faculty identify as African American and only 3.6% identify as Hispanic. When diverse voices are left out of AI, the reliability and fairness of AI systems come into question. Bio: Tess Posner is the CEO of AI4ALL, where she works to make artificial intelligence more diverse and inclusive and to ensure that AI is developed responsibly. Previously, she was Managing Director of TechHire, a national initiative launched out of the White House to increase diversity in the tech economy.

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/jakub-hava-h2oai-productionizing-apache-spark-models-using-h2o-h2o-world-sf Spark pipelines represent a powerful concept to support productionizing machine learning workflows. Their API allows to combine data processing with machine learning algorithms and opens opportunities for integration with various machine learning libraries. However, to benefit from the power of pipelines, their users need to have a freedom to choose and experiment with any machine learning algorithm or library. Therefore, we developed Sparkling Water that embeds H2O machine learning library of advanced algorithms into the Spark ecosystem and exposes them via pipeline API. Furthermore, the algorithms benefit from H2O MOJOs – Model Object Optimized – a powerful concept shared across entire H2O platform to store and exchange models. The MOJOs are designed for effective model deployment with focus on scoring speed, traceability, exchangeability, and backward compatibility. In this talk we will explain the architecture of Sparkling Water with focus on integration into the Spark pipelines and MOJOs. We’ll demonstrate creation of pipelines integrating H2O machine learning models and their deployments using Scala or Python. Furthermore, we will show how to utilize pre-trained model MOJOs with Spark pipelines. Bio: Jakub (or “Kuba” as we call him) completed his Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Master’s Degree in Software Systems at Charles University in Prague. As a bachelor’s thesis, Kuba wrote a small platform for distributed computing of any types of tasks.

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/patrick-hall-h2oai-human-friendly-machine-learning-h2o-world-san-francisco-131369232 This presentation illustrates how to combine innovations from several sub-disciplines of machine learning research to train understandable, fair, trustable, and accurate predictive modeling systems. Techniques from research into fair models, directly interpretable Bayesian or constrained machine learning models, and post-hoc explanations can be used to train transparent, fair, and accurate models and make nearly every aspect of their behavior understandable and accountable to human users. Additional techniques from fairness research can be used to check for sociological bias in model predictions and to preprocess data and post-process predictions to ensure the fairness of predictive models. Finally, applying new testing and debugging techniques, often inspired by best practices in software engineering, can increase the trustworthiness of model predictions on unseen data. Together these techniques create a new and truly human-friendly type of machine learning suitable for use in business- and life-critical decision support. Patrick Hall is senior director for data science products at H2O.ai where he focuses mainly on model interpretability. Patrick is also currently an adjunct professor in the Department of Decision Sciences at George Washington University, where he teaches graduate classes in data mining and machine learning.

Slides from the session can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/leland-wilkinson-h2oai-autoviz-with-h2o-driverless-ai-h2o-world-sf We wish to read datasets (text, logs, relational tables, hierarchies, streams, images, ...) and display interesting aspects of their content. The design to do this rests on the grammar of graphics, scagnostics, and a modeler based on the logic of statistical analysis. We distinguish an automatic visualization system (AVS) from an automated visualization system. The former automatically makes decisions about what is to be visualized. The latter is a programming system for automating the production of charts, graphs and visualizations. An AVS is designed to provide a first glance at data before modeling and analysis are done. AVS is designed to protect researchers from ignoring missing data, outliers, miscodes and other anomalies that can violate statistical assumptions or otherwise jeopardize the validity of models. This webinar will cover the theory and operation of the AutoViz implementation of AVS inside Driverless AI. Leland's Bio: Leland Wilkinson is Chief Scientist at H2O and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. He received an A.B. degree from Harvard in 1966, an S.T.B. degree from Harvard Divinity School in 1969, and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1975. Wilkinson wrote the SYSTAT statistical package and founded SYSTAT Inc. in 1984. After the company grew to 50 employees, he sold SYSTAT to SPSS in 1994 and worked there for ten years on research and development of visualization systems. Wilkinson subsequently worked at Skytree and Tableau before joining H2O.	28	Science & Technology	PT21M17S	1277	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OexU-fWwS8I/maxresdefault.jpg		338			0	0

This meetup was recorded in Mountain View, California on January 24th 2019. Slides from the meetup can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/get-handson-with-explainable-ai-at-machine-learning-interpretabilitymli-gym Description: With the effort and contributions from researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, Machine Learning Interpretation has become a young sub-field of ML. However, the norms around its definition and understanding is still in its infancy and there are numerous different approaches emerging rapidly. However, there seems to be a lack of a consistent explanation framework to evaluate and consistently benchmark different algorithms - evaluating against interpretation, completeness and consistency of the algorithms. The idea with the gym is to provide a controlled interactive environment for all forms of Machine Learning algorithms, - initially focusing on supervised predictive modeling problems, to allow analysts and data-scientists to explore, debug and generate insightful understanding of the models by 1.Model Validation: Ways to explore and validate black box ML systems enabling model comparison both globally and locally - identifying biases in the training data through interpretation. 2.What-if Analysis: An interactive environment where communication can happen i.e. enable learning through interactions. User having the ability to conduct "What-If" analysis - effect of single or multiple features and their interactions 3.Model Debugging: Ways to analyze the misbehavior of the model by exploring counterfactual examples(adversarial examples and training) 4. Interpretable Models: Ability to build natively interpretable models - with the goal to simplify complex models to enable better understanding. The central concept with MLI gym is to have an interactive environment where one could explore and simulate variations in the world(a world post a model is operationalized) beyond the defined model metrics point estimates - e.g. ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, RMSE, R2 score and others. Speaker's Bio: Pramit is a Lead Data Scientist/ at H2O.ai. His area of interests is building Statistical/Machine Learning models(Bayesian and Frequentist Modeling techniques) to help the business realize their data-driven goals. Currently, he is exploring "Model Interpretation" as means to efficiently understand the true nature of predictive models to enable model robustness and security. He believes effective Model Inference coupled with Adversarial training could lead to building trustworthy models with known blind spots. He has started an open source project Skater: https://github.com/datascienceinc/Skater to solve the need for Model Inference.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H28M56S	1736	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mc_KSibrRVc/maxresdefault.jpg		1367			0	3

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/introduction-to-deep-learning-keras-and-tensorflow-128124587 This fast-paced session starts with a simple yet complete neural network (no frameworks), followed by an overview of activation functions, cost functions, backpropagation, and then a quick dive into CNNs. Next, we'll create a neural network using Keras, followed by an introduction to TensorFlow and TensorBoard. For best results, familiarity with basic vectors and matrices, inner (aka "dot") products of vectors, and rudimentary Python is definitely helpful. If time permits, we'll look at the UAT, CLT, and the Fixed Point Theorem. (Bonus points if you know Zorn's Lemma, the Well-Ordering Theorem, and the Axiom of Choice.) Oswald's Bio: Oswald Campesato is an education junkie: a former Ph.D. Candidate in Mathematics (ABD), with multiple Master's and 2 Bachelor's degrees. In a previous career, he worked in South America, Italy, and the French Riviera, which enabled him to travel to 70 countries throughout the world. He has worked in American and Japanese corporations and start-ups, as C/C++ and Java developer to CTO. He works in the web and mobile space, conducts training sessions in Android, Java, Angular 2, and ReactJS, and he writes graphics code for fun. He's comfortable in four languages and aspires to become proficient in Japanese, ideally sometime in the next two decades. He enjoys collaborating with people who share his passion for learning the latest cool stuff, and he's currently working on his 15th book, which is about Angular 2.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H4M1S	241	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yG1UJEzpJ64/maxresdefault.jpg		481			0	0

Slides from the meetup can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/productionizing-h2o-models-with-apache-spark Spark pipelines represent a powerful concept to support productionizing machine learning workflows. Their API allows to combine data processing with machine learning algorithms and opens opportunities for integration with various machine learning libraries. However, to benefit from the power of pipelines, their users need to have a freedom to choose and experiment with any machine learning algorithm or library. Therefore, we developed Sparkling Water that embeds H2O machine learning library of advanced algorithms into the Spark ecosystem and exposes them via pipeline API. Furthermore, the algorithms benefit from H2O MOJOs - Model Object Optimized - a powerful concept shared across entire H2O platform to store and exchange models. The MOJOs are designed for effective model deployment with focus on scoring speed, traceability, exchangeability, and backward compatibility. In this talk we will explain the architecture of Sparkling Water with focus on integration into the Spark pipelines and MOJOs. We’ll demonstrate creation of pipelines integrating H2O machine learning models and their deployments using Scala or Python. Furthermore, we will show how to utilize pre-trained model MOJOs with Spark pipelines. Speaker's Bio: Michal is the VP of Engineering at H2O.ai!

Those who do have an AI/ML strategy struggle to find qualified data scientists; and once they find them, even advanced data scientists need a lot of time—even months—to build and deploy ML models. These challenges put significant limits on the range and number of problems a business can solve. In this webinar, learn how H2O Driverless AI on Amazon Web Services (AWS) automates the best practices of leading data scientists to create advanced machine learning models automatically. With these production-ready models, relative newcomers to AI/ML can generate reliable results and scale-up AI programs that anticipate and capitalize on trends, optimize supply chains, understand customer demand, match consumers with goods and services, and much more.

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/h2o-machine-learning-with-knime-analytics-platform-christian-dietz-h2o-ai-world-london-123150272 KNIME Analytics Platform is an easy to use and comprehensive open source data integration, analysis, and exploration platform, enabling data scientists to visually compose end to end data analysis workflows. The over 2,000 available modules ("nodes") cover each step of the analysis workflow, including blending heterogeneous data types, data transformation, wrangling and cleansing, advanced data visualization, or model training and deployment. Many of these nodes are provided through open source integrations (why reinvent the wheel?). This provides seamless access to large open source projects such as Keras and Tensorflow for deep learning, Apache Spark for big data processing, Python and R for scripting, and more. These integrations can be used in combination with other KNIME nodes meaning that data scientists can freely select from a vast variety of options when tackling an analysis problem. The integration of H2O in KNIME offers an extensive number of nodes and encapsulating functionalities of the H2O open source machine learning libraries, making it easy to use H2O algorithms from a KNIME workflow without touching any code - each of the H2O nodes looks and feels just like a normal KNIME node - and the data scientist benefits from the high performance libraries and proven quality of H2O during execution. For prototyping these algorithms are executed locally, however training and deployment can easily be scaled up using a Sparkling Water cluster. In our talk we give a short introduction to KNIME Analytics Platform and then demonstrate how data scientists benefit from using KNIME Analytics Platform and H2O Machine Learning in combination by using a real world analysis example. Bio: Christian received a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Konstanz. Having gained experience as a research software engineer at the University of Konstanz, where he developed frameworks and libraries in the fields of bioimage analysis and machine learning, Christian moved on to become a software engineer at KNIME. He now focuses on developing new functionalities and extensions for KNIME Analytics Platform. Some of his recent projects include deep learning integrations built upon Keras and Tensorflow, extensions for image analysis and active learning, and the integration of H2O Machine Learning and H2O Sparkling Water in KNIME Analytics Platform.

Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/productionizing-h2o-models-with-apache-spark-jakub-hava-h2o-ai-world-london-2018-123150392 Slides from the video can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/productionizing-h2o-models-with-apache-spark-jakub-hava-h2o-ai-world-london-2018 Spark pipelines represent a powerful concept to support productionizing machine learning workflows. Their API allows to combine data processing with machine learning algorithms and opens opportunities for integration with various machine learning libraries. However, to benefit from the power of pipelines, their users need to have a freedom to choose and experiment with any machine learning algorithm or library. Therefore, we developed Sparkling Water that embeds H2O machine learning library of advanced algorithms into the Spark ecosystem and exposes them via pipeline API. Furthermore, the algorithms benefit from H2O MOJOs - Model Object Optimized - a powerful concept shared across entire H2O platform to store and exchange models. The MOJOs are designed for effective model deployment with focus on scoring speed, traceability, exchangeability, and backward compatibility. In this talk we will explain the architecture of Sparkling Water with focus on integration into the Spark pipelines and MOJOs.

Slides from the talk can be viewed here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/scalable-automatic-machine-learning-with-h2o-erin-ledell-h2o-ai-world-london-2018/0xdata/scalable-automatic-machine-learning-with-h2o-erin-ledell-h2o-ai-world-london-2018 In this presentation, Erin LeDell (Chief Machine Learning Scientist, H2O.ai), will provide a history and overview of the field of "Automatic Machine Learning" (AutoML), followed by a detailed look inside H2O's AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance). The result of the AutoML run is a "leaderboard" of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production. AutoML is available in all H2O interfaces (R, Python, Scala, web GUI) and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, can scale to very large datasets. The presentation will end with a demo of H2O AutoML in R and Python, including a handful of code examples to get you started using automatic machine learning on your own projects.

Wildbook, a project of tech for conservation non-profit Wild Me, is an autonomous computational system that starts from massive collections of images and, by detecting various species of animals and identifying individuals, combined with sophisticated data management, turns them into high resolution information database, enabling scientific inquiry, conservation, and citizen science. We have built Wildbooks for over 20 species of animals, including whales (flukebook.org), sharks (whaleshark.org), giraffes (giraffespotter.org), and, with H2O.ai's help, working on elephants. In January 2016, Wildbook enabled the first ever full species (the endangered Grevy's zebra) census using photographs taken by ordinary citizens in Kenya.The resulting numbers are now the official species census used by IUCN Red List and we repeated the effort in 2018, becoming the first certified census from an outside organization accepted by the Kenyan government. Wildbook is becoming the data foundation for wildlife science, conservation, and policy.

Your AI Needs and IA (Your Artifical Intelligence Needs an Infrastructure Agenda) The poet A. R. Ammons once wrote, "A word too much repeated falls out of being" and although the term AI (encompassing machine & deep learning domains) for sure feels "too much repeated',' it's not about to fall "out of being" any time soon. In this session you'll hear about how your artificial intelligence (AI) needs an infrastructure agenda (IA). As business hopes move from phases rennovaton to those of innovation, there's a massive problem: talent, trust, and time. All of these friction points to realising the true value of AI. In this sesion, which include live demos and won't be your standards set of powerpoint slideware, you'll hear how the things H20 and IBM are partnering around to empower the many on the journey to AI. Bio: Paul C. Zikopoulos, is the VP of Cognitive BigData Systems at IBM. He’s an award winning writer and speaker who has been consulted on the topic of BigData by the popular TV show “60 Minutes,” advises various universities on their graduate analytics programs, and named to over a dozen “Experts to Follow” lists in social media. You’ll also find Paul taking a very active role around Women in Technology (including a seated board member for Women 2.0 - a global brand for women in tech and entrepreneurship that works to close the gender gaps of tech companies). Paul has written 19 books and over 360 articles on data. He doesn’t think NoSQL is something you put on a resume if you don’t have SQL skills and he knows JSON isn’t a person in his department. Ultimately, Paul is trying to figure out the world according to Chloë—his daughter, whom he notes didn’t come with a handbook and is more complex than the topic of BigData itself, but more fun too.

Slides from the meetup can be found here: https://github.com/jphall663/jsm_2018_slides/blob/master/main.pdf Description: The good news is building fair, accountable, and transparent machine learning systems is possible. The bad news is it’s harder than many blogs and software package docs would have you believe. The truth is nearly all interpretable machine learning techniques generate approximate explanations, that the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML) are very new, and that few best practices have been widely agreed upon. This combination can lead to some ugly outcomes! This talk aims to make your interpretable machine learning project a success by describing fundamental technical challenges you will face in building an interpretable machine learning system, defining the real-world value proposition of approximate explanations for exact models, and then outlining the following viable techniques for debugging, explaining, and testing machine learning models Speaker's Bio: Patrick Hall is a senior director for data science products at H2o.ai where he focuses mainly on model interpretability. Patrick is also currently an adjunct professor in the Department of Decision Sciences at George Washington University, where he teaches graduate classes in data mining and machine learning.

Description: Today, credit and debit card fraud detection machine learning models are a critical component of a financial institution’s fraud mitigation operations. Predictive performance of these models is extremely important to help catch fraudsters and shut down a customer’s compromised card as soon as possible. Because of this, data scientists often focus all efforts on the training phase of the model life cycle, trying to squeeze out as much predictive power as possible. In highly regulated U.S. banks, and really anywhere one is deploying machine learning models for critical business results, carefully delivering the models that final mile into production can be just as important. In this talk, we explore two ways data scientists can help deliver in the final mile: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) fraud model interpretability and model monitoring.

Session Description: Spark pipelines represent a powerful concept to support productionizing machine learning workflows. Their API allows to combine data processing with machine learning algorithms and opens opportunities for integration with various machine learning libraries. However, to benefit from the power of pipelines, their users need to have a freedom to choose and experiment with any machine learning algorithm or library. Therefore, we developed Sparkling Water that embeds H2O machine learning library of advanced algorithms into the Spark ecosystem and exposes them via pipeline API. Furthermore, the algorithms benefit from H2O MOJOs – Model Object Optimized – a powerful concept shared across entire H2O platform to store and exchange models. The MOJOs are designed for effective model deployment with focus on scoring speed, traceability, exchangeability, and backward compatibility. In this talk we will explain the architecture of Sparkling Water with focus on integration into the Spark pipelines and MOJOs. We’ll demonstrate creation of pipelines integrating H2O machine learning models and their deployments using Scala or Python. Furthermore, we will show how to utilize pre-trained model MOJOs with Spark pipelines. Speaker's Bio: Jakub (or "Kuba") finished his bachelors degree in computer science at Charles University in Prague, and is currently finishing his master's in software engineering as well. As a bachelors thesis, Kuba wrote a small platform for distributed computing of tasks of any type. On his current masters studies he's developing a cluster monitoring tool for JVM based languages which should make debugging and reasoning about performance of distributed systems easier using a concept called distributed stack traces. At H2O, Kuba mostly works on our Sparkling Water project.	28	Science & Technology	PT12M34S	754	2d	sd	false			1856			0	0

It fully automates some of the most challenging and productive tasks in applied data science such as feature engineering, model tuning, model ensembling and model deployment. Driverless AI turns Kaggle-winning grandmaster recipes into production-ready code, and is specifically designed to avoid common mistakes such as under- or overfitting, data leakage or improper model validation, some of the hardest challenges in data science. Avoiding these pitfalls alone can save weeks or more for each model, and is necessary to achieve high modeling accuracy, especially for time-series problems. With Driverless AI, data scientists of all proficiency levels can train and deploy modeling pipelines with just a few clicks from the GUI. Advanced users can use the client API from Python. Driverless AI builds hundreds or thousands of models under the hood to select the best feature engineering and modeling pipeline for every specific problem such as churn prediction, fraud detection, real-estate pricing, store sales prediction, marketing ad campaigns and many more. To speed up training, Driverless AI uses highly optimized C++/CUDA algorithms to take full advantage of the latest compute hardware. For example, Driverless AI runs orders of magnitudes faster on the latest Nvidia GPU supercomputers on Intel and IBM platforms, both in the cloud or on premise. Driverless AI is fully supported on all major cloud providers. There are two more product innovations in Driverless AI: statistically rigorous automatic data visualization and machine learning interpretability with reason codes and explanations in plain English. Both help data scientists and analysts to quickly validate the data and the models.

Abstract: The good news is building fair, accountable, and transparent machine learning systems is possible. The bad news is it’s harder than many blogs and software package docs would have you believe. The truth is nearly all interpretable machine learning techniques generate approximate explanations, that the fields of eXplainable AI (XAI) and Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML) are very new, and that few best practices have been widely agreed upon. This combination can lead to some ugly outcomes! This talk aims to make your interpretable machine learning project a success by describing fundamental technical challenges you will face in building an interpretable machine learning system, defining the real-world value proposition of approximate explanations for exact models, and then outlining the following viable techniques for debugging, explaining, and testing machine learning models: *Model visualizations including decision tree surrogate models, individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, partial dependence plots, and residual analysis. *Reason code generation techniques like LIME, Shapley explanations, and Treeinterpreter. *Sensitivity Analysis. Plenty of guidance on when, and when not, to use these techniques will also be shared, and the talk will conclude by providing guidelines for testing generated explanations themselves for accuracy and stability. Open source examples (with lots of comments and helpful hints) for building interpretable machine learning systems are available to accompany the talk at: https://github.com/jphall663/interpretable_machine_learning_with_python Bio: Patrick Hall is senior director for data science products at H2O.ai where he focuses mainly on model interpretability.

Title: Leadership class computing for basic physics research Abstract: The development and confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics stands as one of the great scientific achievements of the 20th(+) century. The Standard Model, plus Einstein’s theory of gravity, General Relativity, describes all the known interactions amongst all the known particles in the universe. Yet, we have very compelling reasons to believe the Standard Model and the known particles comprise a mere 5% of the total “stuff”in the universe. For example, we observe the universe is composed of matter and not anti-matter, yet the Standard Model predicts the amount of matter and anti-matter should be created in nearly equal amounts. We also observe the universe is composed of approximately 25% Dark Matter: we have no confirmed idea what Dark Matter is, hence it is “Dark”, yet we observe it to be “clump”with the observed galaxies. These puzzles have spawned a substantial international effort to understand why the universe has favored matter over antimatter, to try and detect the interaction of dark matter with matter, and many other challenging fundamental physics puzzles. In order to understand what the experiments are observing (or not), we must be able to predict precisely what the Standard Model predicts. This is a challenging endeavor: One of the cornerstones of the Standard Model is Quantum Chromodynamics, which is the fundamental theory of Nuclear Strong interactions. The only way we know how to compute properties of strongly interacting matter is through the use of a discrete version of the theory which we can simulate on a computer. To make progress, we must utilize Leadership Class High Performance Computers, such as those at Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Speaker's Bio: Dr. AndréWalker-Loud is a Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His research is focused on basic questions in nuclear and particle physics related to probing the limits of our understanding of the Standard Model. This research requires the use of high-performance computing and will flourish in the age of exa-scale computing.	28	Science & Technology	PT24M58S	1498	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/swerWvFkTdE/maxresdefault.jpg		64			0	0

Many CXOs have realized the benefits of AI and many of them want to take the organization towards AI. Here are some questions some have. What is AI? How to prepare to understand AI better? Does my org. need AI? What “components” of AI do I need? How to get talent? How to upgrade the skills of my current team? What challenges can I work on? Do I need the help of consultants? What hardware and software additions do I need to make to my infrastructure? What are the stumbling blocks? How did other orgs do? What are the Dos and Don’ts? Will people lose jobs? How do I manage communication with my teams? How to find “message block holes” in my org? These are some of the question CXOs and the organizations are struggling to answer. I would like to discuss practical approaches to cross the chasm of AI. I will also share some examples and checklists that could be used by orgs. I will try to layout a practical approach on how organizations can transform. Audience: This is for those CXOs, executives and practitioners that are interested in AI. This will also help organizations set up the right AI strategy. About SK: SK is the Chief Product officer AI & ML in Digitalist Group (www.digitalist.global).

With tools like Keras (using Tensorflow as backend) we can build a neutral network with only 3 layers (Embedding, LSTM, Softmax output) in order to "teach" a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun. Will it be like a Shakespearean actor in one instance and talk like Trump in another? How well is the AI against human in writings now and in the future? How creative could an AI be? About Cheuk: With a research background in theoretical physics, Cheuk has transferred her analytical and logical skills in natural science and built a career in Data Science. Cheuk is now a Data Scientist which has broad experience with time series forecasting including ARIMA and Holt-Winters models and machine learning like neural network and deep learning. Interested in NLP, Cheuk is also familiar with RNN, Attention model using bidirectional LSTM, GRU etc. Cheuk has also actively contributed to open source projects like Pandas, Gensim and Dateutil.

Most of the time in a click-baiting manner. This is catalyzed by high profile figures talking about machine learning philosophy, such as intelligence singularities, which creates more confusion for the media. Whilst this great for the publicity of the field, we are unfairly representing what is possible with this, still amazing technological advancement. This talk looks at how we can improve the way we communicate about machine learning in a more objective and representative way - and still maintain the hype. Josh's bio: I'm a developer working to deliver top quality engineering at startup speed with Theodo, a London/Paris startup. We are a lean tech team for hire among startups and large corporates alike - launching MVPs using the latest open source technology. We are tech stack agnostic, working with the highest quality tools for specific product needs, using lean and agile methodologies. Personally, I'm interested in natural language processing and production machine learning systems. Aside from the AI, I have interests in formal verification, concurrent systems, and web development.	28	Science & Technology	PT17M5S	1025	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qdvcz_bnWlg/maxresdefault.jpg		121			0	0

This talk will finish with a live demo of the pipelines in Python and pipeline deployment on a real time streaming application written in Java, giving you a real time experience of running Sparkling Water! Sparkling Water integrates H2O, the open source distributed machine learning platform, with the capabilities of Apache Spark. It allows users to leverage H2O's machine learning algorithms with Apache Spark applications via Scala, Python, R or H2O's Flow GUI, which makes Sparkling Water a great enterprise solution that’s accessible to a wide variety of end-users. Sparkling Water 2.2 was built to coincide with the release of Apache Spark 2.2 and introduces several new features. One of these features is the ability to use several H2O models inside PySpark pipelines. This allows the data scientist to quickly prepare and work on a pipeline which can later be easily deployed into production. Speaker's Bio Jakub (or “Kuba” as we call him) completed his Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Master’s Degree in Software Systems at Charles University in Prague. As a bachelor’s thesis, Kuba wrote a small platform for distributed computing of any types of tasks. During his master’s degree studies, he developed a cluster monitoring tool for JVM based languages which makes debugging and reasoning the performance of distributed systems easier using a concept called distributed stack traces. Kuba enjoys dealing with problems and learning new programming languages. At H2O.ai, Kuba works on Sparkling Water.	28	Science & Technology	PT57M15S	3435	2d	hd	false			1864			0	1

Abstract: Detecting indoor human activity is used for security, patient care, baby monitoring, etc. purposes. Other than having another human being providing the service (i.e. a security guard, a nurse, baby’s mother, etc.), many solutions have been suggested using image processing neural networks that detect patient’s fall, baby walking, door open, etc. Many of these models have achieved higher prediction accuracy rates. But neural networks that use video cameras bring up privacy concerns. Custom-made sensors, though solve the problem, are expensive. Researchers have proposed deep learning (DL) models use wifi signals to detect human activity. This is relatively recent research. I would like to discuss on how to design a DL to detect human activity to use WiFi signals that are available from off-the-shelf wifi routers. I will also discuss the architecture of such models, share the implementation problems and evaluate solutions that may address these problems. Using DL models to detect human activity based on wifi signals is relatively recent activity. Though some probabilistic models were proposed in the past, the latest solutions reveal some exciting techniques. This discussion is intended for DL enthusiasts looking for “how” details. This talk may be useful for executives if they are curious about the “what” of the research. Profile of the speaker: SK Reddy is the Chief Product Officer AI & ML at Digitalist (www.digitalist.global). He is also a successful twice start-up entrepreneur and is an AI and ML expert.

Abstract: The problem of scene classification in surveillance footage is of great importance for ensuring security in public areas. With challenges such as low quality feeds, occlusion, viewpoint variations, background clutter etc. The task is both challenging and error-prone. Therefore it is important to keep the false positives low to maintain a high accuracy of detection. In this paper, we adapt high performing CNN architectures to identify abandoned luggage in a surveillance feed. We explore several CNN based approaches, from Transfer Learning on the Imagenet dataset to object classification using Faster R-CNNs on the COCO dataset. Using network visualization techniques, we gain insight into what the neural network sees and the basis of classification decision. The experiments have been conducted on real world datasets, and highlights the complexity in such classifications. Obtained results indicate that a combination of proposed techniques outperforms the individual approaches. Utkarsh's Bio: Utkarsh is a Technical Director (Machine Learning and AI) at Aisera. He is currently pursuing Post Graduation at Stanford University with specialization on Image Processing and Computer Vision.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H2M42S	162	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDijgGdG_IQ/maxresdefault.jpg		1614			0	2

Follow @h2oai: https://twitter.com/h2oai. - - - Abstract: Usage of AI and machine learning models is likely to become more commonplace as larger swaths of the economy embrace automation and data-driven decision-making. While these predictive systems can be quite accurate, they have been treated as inscrutable black boxes in the past, that produce only numeric predictions with no accompanying explanations. Unfortunately, recent studies and recent events have drawn attention to mathematical and sociological flaws in prominent weak AI and ML systems, but practitioners usually don’t have the right tools to pry open machine learning black-boxes and debug them. This presentation introduces several new approaches to that increase transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in machine learning models. If you are a data scientist or analyst and you want to explain a machine learning model to your customers or managers (or if you have concerns about documentation, validation, or regulatory requirements), then this presentation is for you!

Follow @h2oai: https://twitter.com/h2oai. - - - Abstract: Driverless AI, H2O.ai’s latest product, speeds up data science workflows by automating feature engineering, model tuning, ensembling and model deployment. Driverless AI turns Kaggle-winning recipes into production-ready code, and is specifically designed to avoid common mistakes such as under or overfitting, data leakage or improper model validation. Avoiding these pitfalls alone can save weeks or more for each model, and is necessary to achieve high modeling accuracy. With Driverless AI, everyone can now train and deploy modeling pipelines with just a few clicks from the GUI. Advanced users can use the client/server API through a variety of languages such as Python, Java, C++, go, C# and many more. To speed up training, Driverless AI uses highly optimized C++/CUDA algorithms to take full advantage of the latest compute hardware. For example, Driverless AI runs orders of magnitudes faster on the latest Nvidia GPU supercomputers on Intel and IBM platforms, both in the cloud or on premise. There are two more product innovations in Driverless AI: statistically rigorous automatic data visualization and interactive model interpretation with reason codes and explanations in plain English. Both help data scientists and analysts to quickly validate the data and the models. In this talk, we explain how Driverless AI works and show how easy it is to reach top 5% rankings for several highly competitive Kaggle competitions.

Follow @h2oai: https://twitter.com/h2oai. - - - Abstract: Auto Visualization involves the problem of producing meaningful graphics when presented with data. Relevant to this task are the strategies that expert statisticians and data analysts use to gain insights through visualization, as well as the portfolio of diagnostic methods devised by statisticians in the last 50 years. While some researchers and companies may claim to do automatic visualization, the problem is much deeper than simply producing collections of histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots. The deeper problem is what subset of these graphics is critical to recognizing anomalies, outliers, unusual distributions, missing values, and so on. This talk will cover aspects of this deeper problem and will introduce H2O software that implements some of these algorithms. Leland Wilkinson is Chief Scientist at H2O.ai and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. He received an A.B. degree from Harvard in 1966, an S.T.B. degree from Harvard Divinity School in 1969, and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1975. Wilkinson wrote the SYSTAT statistical package and founded SYSTAT Inc. in 1984. After the company grew to 50 employees, he sold SYSTAT to SPSS in 1994 and worked there for ten years on research and development of visualization systems. Wilkinson subsequently worked at Skytree and Tableau before joining H2O.ai. Wilkinson is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, an elected member of the International Statistical Institute, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Follow @h2oai: https://twitter.com/h2oai. - - - Abstract: The focus of this talk is to provide an introduction to Natural Language Processing with a focus on the Word2Vec algorithm. Word2Vec is an algorithm that trains a shallow neural network model to learn vector representations of words. These vector representations are able to capture the meanings of words. During the talk, we will use H2O's Word2Vec implementation to understand relationships between words in our text data. We will use the model results to find similar words, synonyms, and analogies. We will also use it to showcase how to effectively represent text data for machine learning problems where we will highlight the impact this representation can have on accuracy. The talk will cover the theory behind Word2Vec as well as a demo of a machine learning workflow with text data. Megan's Bio: Megan is a Customer Data Scientist at H2O.ai.

Enjoy the slides: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/intro-to-automl-handson-lab-erin-ledell-machine-learning-scientist-h2oai. Learn more about H2O.ai: https://www.h2o.ai/. Follow @h2oai: https://twitter.com/h2oai. - - - Abstract: In recent years, the demand for machine learning experts has outpaced the supply, despite the surge of people entering the field. To address this gap, there have been big strides in the development of user-friendly machine learning software that can be used by non-experts. Although H2O has made it easier for practitioners to train and deploy machine learning models at scale, there is still a fair bit of knowledge and background in data science that is required to produce high-performing machine learning models. Deep Neural Networks in particular, are notoriously difficult for a non-expert to tune properly. In this presentation, we provide an overview of the field of "Automatic Machine Learning" and introduce the new AutoML functionality in H2O. H2O's AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates the process of training a large, comprehensive selection of candidate models and a stacked ensemble model which, in most cases, will be the top performing model in the AutoML Leaderboard. H2O AutoML is available in all the H2O interfaces including the h2o R package, Python module and the Flow web GUI. We will also provide simple code examples to get you started using AutoML. Erin's Bio: Erin is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai. She is the main author of H2O Ensemble. Before joining H2O, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.

To view the slides, please visit here: https://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/ideas-on-machine-learning-interpretability Abstract: Usage of AI and machine learning models is likely to become more commonplace as larger swaths of the economy embrace automation and data-driven decision-making. While these predictive systems can be quite accurate, they have been treated as inscrutable black boxes in the past, that produce only numeric predictions with no accompanying explanations. Unfortunately, recent studies and recent events have drawn attention to mathematical and sociological flaws in prominent weak AI and ML systems, but practitioners usually don’t have the right tools to pry open machine learning black-boxes and debug them. This presentation introduces several new approaches to that increase transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in machine learning models. If you are a data scientist or analyst and you want to explain a machine learning model to your customers or managers (or if you have concerns about documentation, validation, or regulatory requirements), then this presentation is for you!

Please excuse the audio as this session was recorded live. The focus of this presentation is scalable machine learning using the h2o R and Python packages. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, Stacked Ensembles (aka "Super Learners"), dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. R and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and will be made available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops if they choose. For those interested in running the code on a multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster, an H2O AMI is also available. Speaker Bio: Dr. Erin LeDell is a Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O. Erin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley.

Moreover, scientists, physicians, researchers, analysts, and humans in general have the right to understand and trust models and modeling results that affect their work and their lives. Today many organizations and individuals are embracing deep learning and machine learning algorithms but what happens when people want to explain these impactful, complex technologies to one-another or when these technologies inevitably make mistakes? This talk presents several approaches beyond the error measures and assessment plots typically used to interpret deep learning and machine learning models and results. The talk will include: - Data visualization techniques for representing high-degree interactions and nuanced data structures. - Contemporary linear model variants that incorporate machine learning and are appropriate for use in regulated industry. - Cutting edge approaches for explaining extremely complex deep learning and machine learning models. Wherever possible, interpretability approaches are deconstructed into more basic components suitable for human story telling: complexity, scope, understanding and trust.

In this talk, you'll learn how individuals and corporations have tried to skirt the rules and how they've been caught. As for the clever tax evaders that got away, you'll learn how machine learning can be used to catch them. Unlike rules-based systems, machine learning can learn the nuances of illegal money movement much better than suspicious activity alerts. Come learn how to build a machine-learning model for tax evasion, that is built based on current rules-based systems - and leave better prepared for Tax Day.

Practitioners may prefer ensemble algorithms when model performance is valued above other factors such as model complexity and training time. The Super Learner algorithm, also called "stacking", learns the optimal combination of the base learner fits. The latest version of H2O now contains a "Stacked Ensemble" method, which allows the user to stack H2O models into a Super Learner. The Stacked Ensemble method is the native H2O version of stacking, previously only available in the h2oEnsemble R package, and now enables stacking from all the H2O APIs: Python, R, Scala, etc. Speaker Bio: Erin is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai. Before joining H2O, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io (acquired by GE Digital) and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode) and the founder of DataScientific, Inc.

We use a Jupyter Notebook loaded with the TensorFlow, PySpark and H2O (PySparkling) python modules. In the backend, Apache Spark is running on every node in the cluster. H2O runs in the same JVMs (executors) as a regular Spark job. The data is ingested into H2O, and exposed as a Spark DataFrame by H2O. PySpark performs the translation from the JVM to the Python TensorFlow module, which then translates the code into native C++ that can execute on both GPUs/CPUs. After training a 2-hidden layer neural network (Deep Learning) on MNIST, we convert the TensorFlow model into a H2O Deep Learning model and continue training in H2O. We show how to use the Flow GUI to explore the model, the data and the performance metrics. We also show how to put this model into production with standalone Java (POJO) scoring code. Note: Model parameters are not tuned, performance is not representative of actually achievable results. This is purely an integration demo.

About 80% of Data Science goes into preparing, cleaning, wrangling and munging data. Curating the right data sources is only one part of the operation. NAs and handling missing elements has a big impact on algorithm accuracy. Factor Expansion, Feature engineering and derived fields occupy a good portion of the data science life cycle. In this talk we review tools, techniques and common methods to do Data Munging on small and big data. sed, awk, Python, R, data.table, dplyr are only some methods. Speaker: Matt Dowle is the main author of the data.table package in R. He has worked for some of the world’s largest financial organizations: Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers, Citigroup, Concordia Advisors and Winton Capital. He is particularly pleased that data.table is also used outside Finance, for example Genomics where large and ordered datasets are also researched. 12.15.15 Contribute to H2O open source machine learning software https://github.com/h2oai Check out more slides on open source machine learning software at: http://www.slideshare.net/0xdata	28	Science & Technology	PT54M5S	3245	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4VWQEvYIfV8/maxresdefault.jpg		980			0	0

Unlike traditional interactive computing environments output text, Flow utilizes a "hybrid" user interface that seamlessly blends a command-line shell with a modern point-and-click graphical user interface for every operation in H2O. Flow uniquely simplifies capturing, replaying, annotating, sharing and presenting analysis workflows and uses the bog-standard H2O REST API under the hood; so not only can you can access and manipulate raw H2O objects under the hood, you can also build custom GUI applications using H2O's REST API, right from within Flow.
