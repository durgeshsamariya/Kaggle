So here is the very funny myth, are data scientists geeks? Depending on how you define geeks, certainly data scientists need not be a geek its not that you have to be a nerd, antisocial, social person to be a data scientist. Some aspects of data science like focus deep thinking and so on do help if one has introvert kind of nature, but that’s absolutely not necessary to be an introvert or to be a geek to be a nerd to become a successful data scientist. Often you hear that data science is same as data analysts, data scientists are essentially data analyst. Now there is no standard definition of these terms and that’s where these terms are getting over used hype doesn’t help here always so but in industry more or less you will see that data science is more about building algorithms working with data also writing the fair amount of code you will be writing as data scientists whereas data analyst getting insights form data they can feed into a business decision they can feed into a report for example. So there is fair bit of difference between data scientist and data analyst. Data analyst is for example not required to code most of the time but it is he/she is required to work a lot with data. Data scientist may spend 50% of their time coding and lesser time worrying about how this data is feed into the business decision so yea there is a difference. Data Scientists can predict future? Of course there is no data scientist that can actually predict future what is true in reality is based on the historical data and when that data is sufficiently comprehensive sufficient volume is there for the data sufficient time duration is covered for the data it has been shown that you can for example predict results of elections results of some games and so on but again that is all based on the patterns which are mined.	27	Education	PT8M43S	523	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2euavGojjL8/maxresdefault.jpg		2006	69	2	0	19

So if you have a good understanding of your basic concepts, it will be very helpful for you to interpret the results of your models. My advice to all aspiring learners would be to be curious, have a little Knack for math and have a learning mindset. How to technically go about it is, I will divide it into four stages. First is learning about statistics and algebra, the math part of it. Second would be to be able to implement what you have learnt which categorises dealing with technology or tools you would want to learn about, say GitHub, spark, online editors. Then followed by to be able to develop A hypothesis which is to convert a problem statement into a machine learning algorithm. How to translate on problem statement into machine learning algorithms, what to choose and what to validate from there. Then the final stage is learning about different domains, different sectors and how you can use that information, how you can leverage that machine learning algorithms to be used into certain kind of problem statements based on the domain that you are working with. My advice to aspiring learners would be to get their basics right. We have discussed a lot of skills that are necessary to get into data science jobs earlier in this video so you have to kind of improve your programming skills, improve your mathematical skills. Apart from all that you should also keep yourself updated on what is happening in the industry. The best way to do that would be to follow a lot of twitter handles or posts or blogs wherein people discuss a lot about the research happening in the industry. So these are some of the ways which you can keep learning. This will enhance your data science skills, make it easier for you to transition into any data science roles. So, here is very brief advice for anybody who is aspiring to make a career in data science. Take the pain, take the patience to get into the depth of anything that you are building. It’s okay to not have ten projects on your portfolio when you are starting out just have one project but do it really well go to the depth of the project so that any expert in the data science cannot confuse you for that one project anybody should be able to ask you why why why five times in the row and you still should have an answer to why you did that step of why you built this why you make that choice why did you use that language why did you use this technique and so on? So really this ability to ask why, why am I saying this result, this x y z are the reasons why.	27	Education	PT4M15S	255	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATps5GAPxdc/maxresdefault.jpg		2360	92	3	0	19

There are many jobs that are opening up in UI/UX Design, what really is UX Design? That’s a great question, it’s becoming a popular term and it’s also becoming more well known in the industry. It’s essentially understanding the customer and designing an experience for the customer that covers various different aspects such as tech, such as understanding their requirements, what they see, what they experience with all their senses is essentially the user experience. What is UI then? So UI or user interface is one part of the user experience, it’s one of the touch points the customer interfaces with, that is what they see and that’s what they touch now there is on touch devices or if it’s a computer then it’s something that you use online but that interface that communicated the brand or the service or the product to the customer is the user interface and because that is a very important way or the very useful way to communicate with the customer, it plays a huge role in the communication of the service or the product to the customer. So you would say what we see on the screen, the visual bit of it is UI Design? Yes, what you see it’s the visual part but it’s also the text. It’s how you read it, how easy it is to understand. I think the real advantage of a good user interface is visualisation. The general customer doesn’t like to read too much information, so giving the content hierarchy, visualising it, making it legible and easy to understand are the important decisions you need to take while defining a user interface. So essentially we are saying user experience is the journey a user takes from the beginning till the end of using a product and a user experience is a critical part in defining that journey. So tell me how are the roles of a UX designer and UI designer different then? So I think like your correctly defined user interface is a subset of user experience. So a user experience designer would have a much larger picture of the entire journey. They would be involved in the decision of features of which features to the wheel, all the way up to how the customer perceives and understands the UI. So they would be involved in the tech, they would be involved in the marketing. They would have to have a grasp on the entire product or service. The user interface designer need not necessarily have so of course it would be good to have them as well involved, be involved from the start but a user interface designer can also enter the project or the product at a time when many parameters have already been defined like the features, the work flows or even the wire frames and the concentrate just on applying the brand colours, themes and visualise the content to create a good interactive interface. So essentially you are saying that UX design is about a journey that the user takes from the beginning of the product, beginning of using the product till the end and UI is a critical part of it. But tell me how are the roles of a UX designer and UI designer different then? So being a UX designer you don’t necessarily have to be a UI designer but you need to be able to take control of the entire journey, entire customer journey. You need to have an understanding of various factors that take part in the journey so the tech for example.	27	Education	PT13M50S	830	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pg9nLNonrTM/maxresdefault.jpg		17330	431	14	0	40

This goes back to the date when I was working at IBM research as an engineer and I needed to learn machine learning for one of the projects I was working on and this was way back in 2012 before it was at the peak of the hype curve or there were many resources to learn these skills. So I happened to chance upon one of the early moocs, this was actually by the founder of Coursera, Andrew Ng who is a very well renowned authority in the field of machine learning and I really enjoyed the course and the ability to learn from the world’s best experts. And also I had a very unique situation at that time. I had a full time job, I had a 2 year old child, so basically life was really difficult to fit this learning into my schedule. When I was able to learn through online in my own schedule I realised that this is how education should be. It should be open and accessible to anybody who wants to learn regardless of their life circumstances. And that really got me excited about doing something to make education accessible to everyone in the world. Entrepreneurship is definitely one of the most challenging and fulfilling things I have done in my life. So definitely the thing I like most about Springboard is the mission and the impact that we see every day on our students’ lives but beyond that Silicon Valley is considered the cradle of innovation and a place where some of the world’s smartest entrepreneurs are. So that the fact is that we as an organisation have been able to make our mark in that world and create an impact is really satisfying and humbling. Diversity is really a vast and complex problem and it will take a lot of different systemic holistic initiatives to really beat it but there are many little things that we can do to start to make a dent in it. And the biggest one I think will help is the importance of role models at every stage. So when I was a little girl it wasn’t very common for women in the household to work. My mother, my aunts, none of them, even if they were brilliant were even allowed to work sometimes. And that almost sets subconsciously precedence in people in girls’ minds that they are not expected, they probably shouldn’t even aspire to. Thankfully that is changing in our generation and we need to just increase that at every level. All of us need to see more role models and all of us really need to share our stories, our experiences, yes it’s never easy but there are so many great women who are breaking out and doing wonderful things and if you talk to them, if you have a conversation you will realise that it’s possible and I think that can go a long way in encouraging more women. At Springboard we help people break into tech careers with one on one mentorship and a job guarantee	27	Education	PT9M20S	560	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zQPq7OKqyZw/maxresdefault.jpg		779	30	1	0	1

I am a data scientist at Walmart labs for past one year. Before I proceed, I would want you guys to subscribe to Springboard India to stay updated for upcoming videos. I have been asked this a lot that data science is all about tools. So data science is as less about tools as computer is to computer science. There is a lot of science and a lot of work which goes before and after you actually come to using the tools. There is lot of exploration of data, a lot of evaluation metrics which you need to know and also background of what you are actually using, it’s an essential element when you come to data science. So I would say data science is far away from tools as you can imagine. Another thing is that people often think that the coding background is a must to become a data scientist, so a lot of my colleagues and very smart people which I have worked with are not actually from computer science background, some of them are from electrical, some of them are from industrial. So it doesn’t really matter if you are from a computer science background or you have coding background because this is something you can pick up while you are working on data science and this wouldn’t really be as much of a blocker if you are willing to learn and if you have the nack of solving problems I don’t think that this is actually any hindrance to your progress when you are looking to be a data scientist. I have also been asked opposite things as well that, can we become data scientist without actually indulging into coding ever, again this is also not true because as I have been talking that you are responsible of taking your ideas and your solutions to production. You need to know how to write production ready code once you are done solving the problem. So yes, it’s neither here nor there. Also lot of times when I tell people that I am a data scientist, lot of people confuse it me being a data analyst, so there is a thin line between both the spaces. Analytics has a lot to do with inputs which are going on the backend of the things, meanwhile data science as a problem solving, lot of times we sort of contribute to what is going in the front lines. A lot of times, a lot of decisions and lot of important calls are made based on the work we do. So there is, analytics as a space and data science as a space are pretty far apart I would say. So a lot of time people often mistake data scientist for an oracle, thinking that we can predict future. So predictive modelling is a very small part of data science. Data science is a very vast universe where a lot of streams and a lot of areas of expertise you can do. There is deep learning, there is language processing. You can use data science to translate one language to another. You can use data science to actually figure out if two images are similar or what is happening in a video stream. People are building self-driving cars out of it now. So predictive modelling is not really all we do. It’s a very vast space and predictive modelling is just a part of it. So also a lot of time people tend to overlook basic concepts like probability, statistics, linear algebra. They think that they can overlook this and sort of get a hold of data science which not really is true because if you have to have a good understanding and a deep knowledge of what data science model is doing, how it is doing, how can you make it better and how can you actually use it to solve the problem which are presented to you, the knowledge of these three concepts is very imp	27	Education	PT5M36S	336	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iUt__GEYteU/maxresdefault.jpg		5382	137	3	0	15

Design is becoming a priority for organisations worldwide. If data is the salad then design is the dressing on the salad because the penetration of Internet and digital products is so high and is increasing everyday, there are websites and mobile apps that we consume on and everyday basis. There are a lot of competing products that have for everything. If you want to take a ride, if you want to order food, if you want to buy something, there are multiple products that you can choose from and it is the product that will have good design, good user experience that will stand out. In fact LinkedIn created an economic graph and they predicted that design and especially UI/UX design is going to be one of the fastest growing skills and job market. Not just globally but also in India. There has been an India skills report which also put design in one of the top 5 skills for 2019-20. Now UI/UX design concerns itself mostly with screen and because we consume most of the products, most of our activities are now done online, design is actually becoming mostly synonymous with UI/UX design. UX design is user experience design, so think of how you feel or how a users feel when they are interacting with a product. How easy is it to navigate the website or the mobile app, how easy is it to check out something, can you pay easily. Is there the website very intuitive to navigate through and UI which is the user interface is the visual aspects of it. How does the mobile app look, is it appealing in terms of color? Are the fonts easy to read? Is the placing of different elements on the mobile app and websites like buttons, text boxes, heading, is that all visually appealing? So together, UI the visual aspect and the interaction aspects of how humans interact with websites and apps from the UI/UX design. And its not vey difficult to understand why this is going to be very important skill and why these jobs are going to grow. As we move more and more towards digital products, as there are more and more data collected there will be insights that we will use from this data and they will be used to create something. Now those products that will be created will have to be user friendly, will have to be appealing and so there has to be a good design for it. And that’s why I said if data is the salad then design in the dressing for it. So we know that there are jobs that need UI/UX designers. These jobs are only going to grow and we need to create this army of people, these army of designers who will be fill in these jobs. Two: there are not enough courses at the moment that’s nerve this need. So traditional universities do have some options for design but UI/UX design is fairly new and there are not too many course where you can learn UI/UX design. This is even more so for online options so if you are already in a job and you want to learn UI/UX design there are practically no options available, If you wanted to do just an online self pace course. And that tell us that there is a demand for.	27	Education	PT13M3S	783	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZW0RziDncaU/maxresdefault.jpg		1724	47	1	0	8

Right from data engineers to ML engineers to data scientists to machine learning scientists to data analysts and even business analysts. And there is often confusing which role to pick. People often say I come from a certain background and not sure which path to take and I think having a mentor really helps in these situations to figure out what opportunities to pursue given a particular background and what is the course of action to be taken to reach there. While a lot of data is available online, in fact, to pick up data science, mentorships even helps to understand you know keep track of progress and get a more high-level idea on what are the kind of project you want to do if you want to land in a certain kind of job and also what are the kind of domains you want to pick based on your experience. So I think having a mentor and having a little bit of that extra advice goes a long way in making the right decision. So there are multiple types of roles in the data science industry and there is a lot of confusion around them, so let me clear that out. Data science is a multidisciplinary field which involves skills from statistics, probability, machine learning, software engineering and combinations of these result in different titles and roles which might confuse people. Broadly there are roles like data engineer, infrastructure engineer, so their roles are not typically data science roles but they are more of a support system around data scientists. They help data scientist do their job. So when it comes to data science there are three categories, even though there is still confusion around them but gradually some clarity is coming up. So data science role, there are three roles. The first role is a data analyst role, the data analyst is a person who is responsible for reporting, summarizing data, using basic statistics in SQL and Python to help business decision-makers take those decisions and also help data scientist do that projects. So typically this role is..companies do hire for these roles, almost every company hire for this kind of role. The second role is more of a data scientist which goes a little deeper into the problem. They work on problems like fraud detection, recommender system where they work with much more scientific rigor than a data analyst. The typical skills which are required to do this thing are statistics, programming languages, machine learning and etc. But these people don’t have a strong background in software engineering so in a product based setup they pair up with a machine learning engineer to put that model into production which brings me to the third part which is the machine learning engineer. Machine learning engineer is a person who has a strong foundation in software engineering but also understands machine learning so that they can put the, in a product based setup these people can put machine learning models into production integrate with the core software. So coming to the companies that hire for these kinds of roles, so companies are hiring for data analysts also, data scientists also, machine learning engineers also.	27	Education	PT4M5S	245	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRaVsOl-kYc/maxresdefault.jpg		3228	88	1	0	10

I am a senior data scientist with Brillio. I started off my career as an application developer at IBM, a few months in Accenture and then I moved on to Harman. My entry into data science happened in the year 2014. So I still remember the first time that a senior member from my team came and spoke to me about the titanic data set, titanic problem. She said I can predict if you would have survived the Titanic crash. I just laughed it out on her face. She was damn serious but I was like how can you even do that? So that’s when she started explaining to me what machine learning is, about what data science is. So that kind of piqued my interest in this field of machine learning and data science. So I was into .NET back then so I had my deliverables and projects and all that but then I was in my heart I was convinced that I should be doing this. I should have to, even if I don’t succeed it’s fine but I wanted to try this out and find out if it is for me. So that’s the day I decided and I started putting my effort into learning r, I have a pretty good programming background. I am a computer science engineer, so I started learning r. I went back 10 years through my career and I started learning maths and statistics and fundamentals of calculus, algebra, linear algebra and all that. So believe me it was not an overnight thing. I took almost one year to actually start thinking like a data scientist, looking at data like how a data scientist would look at data in order to get things. So slowly it so happens that I was lucky enough to get an opportunity within my own project. They introduced the analytics component into my project and I slowly started getting involved in their team meetings and stuff like that. And at some point when I was able to prove, my manager believed that I could go further in it. So that is my journey into machine learning. To all those people who are aspiring to be data scientists, like I said it’s not an overnight job, you have to work hard, you have to work smart, you will be there one day. Hi this is Chirasmita, I have been working in the field of data science from last 5 years and I started my career with healthcare insurance and moved to people analytics, semiconductor analytics and then healthcare R&D and now I have moved to smaller roles where I am trying to set up teams, data science teams for different start-ups across Bangalore. The journey has been pretty rewarding for me like it basically stemmed out from the fear of missing out, from like I didn’t want to go for an IT role when I was graduating from an engineering background. So that’s when IBM was launching into big data, it was just a catchphrase and it just caught me and I wanted to know more about it. So I just went for a The Grace Hopper Celebration scholarship and then that’s when it really started that I pursued a Yahoo researcher who took me as an intern and we built a recommendation system as part of my internship. And post that I got my first job offer with opera solutions and it was into healthcare consulting and I think I have been challenged to work as day to day in various aspects of problems using tech data, very messy data, noisy data and using lot of imaging problems. So learning to apply and adapt and see where the industry is heading has been pretty challenging. And it’s like you really need to be on your feet all the time so there is this always like.	27	Education	PT4M44S	284	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5pzkcZXh5bg/maxresdefault.jpg		1485	49	0	0	7

In this video today we bring you the best career and interview advice from the real-life data scientists but before we get started do not forget to subscribe to the Springboard India channel to stay updated on the upcoming interviews with real-life data practitioners. Hi, my name is Shweta, and I am a data scientist at Youplus. I build products using natural language processing and deep learning. A lot of data science aspirants have asked me this question that how can they successfully transition into a data science job if they have started as a data analyst or as a software engineer and once they have decided to pursue data science, what I suggest would be you know you should identify where your strengths are, whether it is machine learning, whether it is inferential statistics or exploratory data analysis that you are interested in and the hone those skills and I think mentor, a good mentor can help the learner identify strengths and in the long run how this helps the learner is that they can build a lifelong relationship with the mentor and they can be available for them for making future career decisions as well. Hi, my name is Jaidev Deshpande. I work as a senior data scientist at Gramener where we build tools and applications that help people narrate stories with data with machine learning and we help people extract insights out of their data. So there is nobody who doesn’t use data science. It’s ubiquitous, it's omnipresent, it’s everywhere and also equally importantly there is no specific skills as such that are inherent in people that make them a good data scientist. So whatever is required to be a good data scientist can be found in anybody and in fact, I don’t think we should even call them skills. Most of the things or the prerequisites that are required for being a good data scientist or for practicing data science, they are more like habits, they are not skills. So the more you practice programming, the more you practice mathematics, the more you practice statistics the better you are at it and all of these things can be learned. There is nothing that can not be taught, there is nothing that can not be learned. I don’t think there is anything inherent about a data scientist that distinguishes them from the remainder of the people. In fact so much so that I believe that people are learning data science at a younger age, soon this is going to become a fairly common skill in a lot of people. So, ya we are definitely on the right path over there. As far as mentorship is concerned I believe that when you are learning data science when you begin to learn data science, you tend to get a little lonely. There are very few people in your friend circle, family, around you in general who are working on the same problems as you are, who are interested in the same problems as you are. So simply having somebody to talk to is more than half the battle won, that helps a lot. And secondly, you can always learn from the mentors’ experience.	27	Education	PT9M19S	559	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ho6FsmJGdY/maxresdefault.jpg		2999	105	2	0	26

Hi, I am Deep. I started my career back in 2012 as a chartered accountant. I later started self-learning programming through various online courses, in fact, that’s the reason why I joined Springboard. I currently work at Springboard as a backend engineer. In this video, we are going to talk about how to become a programmer. Before we proceed further please subscribe to the Springboard India YouTube channel to stay updated with the latest content. A lot of people ask me about coding versus programming, the difference between these two. There are several ways you can definitely read online as well. Coding for me is the act of literally writing code on your computer or on any device that allows you to write something. Programming, on the other hand, is the act of giving instructions to something by any means. It may or may not be code. For example, you can give instructions by moving your hand through gestures, you can give instructions verbally, you can say to a robot, hey turn on lights for me or something of those sorts. In fact, if you use google home mini or Alexa and if you are telling them to do something for you, that’s a way of programming. Coding is one form of programming. There can be different forms of programming. For me, coding or programming is actually one of the same things. I am a developer, I am a backend engineer. I write programs in python using Django as a web framework. So day to day I write code and that’s my way of building programs, building things and using them on my day to day life. Ok, let’s talk about how long it took me to write code or build programs when I first started. So, my first interaction with coding was through a website called code.org where I started writing small snippets of code like print hello world, I was learning Python and then eventually I moved on to more large courses on several online websites. So when we say how long does it take to write code, to be honest, it doesn’t take more than 15 minutes, as long as you can read English and basics of a computer we are familiar with. But how long does it take to write meaningful programs that you can use in the real world, that’s a bit of a subjective thing. So if you are previously experienced with computer science, even a little bit of around 3 to 6 months, it should not take you more than a week to ten days to write something meaningful.	27	Education	PT9M6S	546	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woJey9dTry0/maxresdefault.jpg		1313	58	2	0	5

I wanted a person who wants to go in data science field, he should be interested in it. He just wants to you know explore that field. He should love it. He should not move into data science field because of the salary or what you have heard around it. The way I, when I started my career I never chase my company or job just because of salary, mostly because of the projects that I want to do it and I want to enjoy my work. What I have seen in some of the interviews that people come and they just try to you know fake things, that okay I have done that and I have done that..its always good when you come in to the interview for a data science thing, if you don’t know things, you can directly tell because we are not looking for a perfect person, we are looking for a person who can learn and who has really interest in data science field. So finally my final advice is just go into data science because you love data science. Just don’t go in data science because you want more salary in data science. A lot of time people tend to overlook basic concepts like probability, statistics, linear algebra. They think that they can overlook this and sort of get a hold of data science which not really is true because if you have to have a good understanding and a deep knowledge of what data science model is doing, how it is doing, how can you make it better and how can you actually use it to solve the problem which are presented to you, the knowledge of these three concepts amongst others is very important. These are the fundamental building blocks which you would require, the basic things which you would require when you transitioning into data science as well. Talking about transitioning into data science, what I would want to say to people who are looking to transition is that first of all you should have a very good clarity of why you want to transition into data science, what excites you about data science. So that you can grasp whatever concepts are there with equal enthusiasm and also never to overlook the basics which are been talked about. Lot of people just see very cool problems today which are being presented out there and try to straight away jump to solving that like image or deep learning but what I would suggest to them is to start up from the basics. Do not skip over that because if you do it correctly you will actually get a better hang of what you are trying to do and you will be a much more versatile and a much more well equipped data scientist. So talking about transitioning to data science, let me also tell you my own story. So while I did masters in statistics and computer graphics, I was a developer before I became a machine learning scientist. So I was a developer but I wanted to transition and at that time like over 10 years back when I tried to transition, there weren’t a lot of resources like there are today. There wasn’t even coursera for instance and the path that I chose to transition.	27	Education	PT5M47S	347	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0GgUKLIqb0/maxresdefault.jpg		1850	74	0	0	18

I have been working in the education and ed-tech industry for over 10 years. Today I am gonna talk about the difference between mentoring and teaching. Before we proceed further and discuss in detail, I will encourage all of you to subscribe to the Springboard India YouTube channel. It will help you to remain updated with all the upcoming videos and different topics of discussion. In my experiences on a day to day basis, many people have come and asked me the difference between teaching and mentoring. This is one common confusion which I find across. The way I see teaching and mentoring are two different concepts altogether. Teaching is a concept where a teacher prepares the lesson, comes to the class and gives his knowledge or her knowledge to the entire class. While mentoring is more of a seeking. The student prepares before the mentoring session, decide what information she wants to know more, she wants to understand more and seek that clarification in the mentor. So in a way, if you look at the teaching is more about a giver concept, it's a giver who is in control of the situation and it's a giver who is deciding what information or knowledge she wants to share with the class. But when it comes to mentoring, mentoring is where the seeker is in control, seeker decides what information, what concepts, what application of concepts I want to understand better and mentor is supposed to provide that clarification or that information knowledge to the seeker. In a way, mentoring is very much like coaching where the responsibility of knowing more, getting information, getting knowledge lies largely with the seekers who is, in this case, is student and teaching is more like a power distance where the person who has the knowledge is supposed to know what he should or she should be sharing with the class and they share with the class. In this case of teaching largely the learning is generalized, however in case of mentoring where the individual is seeking the specific area of information or knowledge highly customized. That is why a one to one mentoring is very much like having a personal coach in industry application, knowledge imparting or career counseling. So let me share a personal example of how a mentor has helped me to transition my career. Having worked for 10 years in the consumer goods industry I was transitioning into the education industry and that’s where having a mentor was a great help. The mentor helped me understand the nuances of the industry. A mentor helped me to understand how my experience and knowledge can be more effective so that I am set up for better success. That’s where I find mentoring is a great concept which can help each individual to suit their need. So each one of us has unique needs and unique aspirations. On top of it, we have a very busy work life. If one chooses to cover the entire process of transitioning herself alone, the process is going to be cumbersome and long drawn. This is where a mentor can be very very helpful. Because if there is a mentor with me, I can learn from the mistakes that the mentor has made, the success mentor has achieved, the insights mentor has gathered. Which will make my process much shorter, much smoother with a much higher probability of success. That is why mentoring is one of the mainstays of the learning experience at Springboard.	27	Education	PT4M56S	296	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XK4niuhe7t0/maxresdefault.jpg		605	19	0	0	3

Also, understand what you did and how it impacted, so my advice would be that it is not just important to understand the tools and tricks and doing a lot of data science work. But it is really important to meet the right people, organically grow your network because this helps in leveraging your skills faster. Also, I would suggest that since the industry is changing so fast, so it is very necessary to keep learning and reading research papers, keep meeting people and know they try to solve a similar problem. Try using it, write a lot of blog posts, read a lot of podcasts. Through the podcast, the whole dynamics of learning is changing and it is very important to be a part of this change and that is a successful data scientist in my opinion. For people who are looking to come into Machine Learning from a different background, there are a number of pathways. As I mentioned earlier, the typical pathway for a Software Engineer and you want to learn Machine Learning or let’s say someone who belongs to a different kind of field and you want to jump into machine learning, it is a great career to have. if you are a Software Engineer pick up techniques that are orthogonal to software engineering that are things like statistics, linear algebra, algorithms from machine learning while picking up some of the software techniques that are particular to machine learning. So toolsets like TensorFlow, Pycharm, Pandas as needed in the software. For somebody who is coming from the other side, the mathematics and statistics already in that case you need to work more on the software engineering side that is you need to pick up a computer language, writing a production-grade code, getting yourself familiar with tools like Git for working in distributed teams and so on. If you are coming from a complete orthogonal filed and I have seen some great candidates coming from a different field doing well. Let’s say if you are from economics and Psychology, then you have to be a little more strategic about how you do it that is analyzing where there are gaps in your knowledge and skillsets. Post this plugin those gaps as needed that is you might need to pick up more software engineering, mathematics, and other toolsets. Another thing that can come in handy here is somebody who can guide you through your journey in data science. This becomes particularly important when you are coming from a completely different field. So the mentor can guide you where your knowledge gaps lie, suggest appropriate resources to cover those gaps. One concluding a piece of advice that I would like to give to all you aspiring data scientist out there is that you are at the right place and at the very right time.	27	Education	PT4M46S	286	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0r5Ikhqu80s/maxresdefault.jpg		2748	95	1	0	7

The thing is when you want to do data science and you are just somebody who has a bachelor’s degree, you are just fresh out of college is that you have a lot of options, you have a lot of online courses that are promising you to train in data science, gives you specific courses and I took a lot of them. What was missing was the fact that, it was not guided right and that becomes a big challenge because when you are starting out, you are looking at a number of problems, you are looking at machine learning, you are looking at NLP, looking at deep learnings so it tends to become confusing. remember I was on LinkedIn Springboard team in India, he reached out to me and he said that look I viewed your profile and it seems like you make the cut for joining our program at Springboard. Before that I hadn’t even heard of Springboard. So I joined up, okay let’s see what can be done. So he was like before you make a decision why don’t you get on a call with one of our mentors. So I got in touch with Chirasmita, she is a data scientist and I spoke to her and I expressed my concerns that I have been taking a lot of courses, what makes this course different? there will be guidance, this is like course. And then I moved on to Springboard website, the courses and really loved the kind of bases that it covered and also the fact that it also lets you choose the kind of specialisation towards the end. And that was it. I was so sold on that, I took a test and I got started with the program. I guess the main reason I would say why I joined Springboard would be course content was fantastic, a fact of guided mentorship and also the fact that there was also a career services help which give you know like job guarantee and stuff. And that is difficult, it’s not like the usual placements, it’s like a guidance that you have from mentors and your career counsellors across the entire course. That helps them get to know you, that helps you get to know yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses and overall that helps you in looking out for jobs once you finished the program. So my learning goal when I joined Springboard was to be able to understand and master the basics of data science. the course curriculum and that seem to have everything from the very beginning to the end. And interestingly you know I discovered Springboard through Prashant on LinkedIn, so that was a very good start I would say and everything that he had promised then actually holds true even now. The kind of access that I got was very important for me and that I believe will help me go a long way in my career. experience with Springboard has been fantastic in the sense that I had a good opportunity to interact with mentors. I had a good opportunity to receive any in any kind of technical trouble, there would probably be obviously somebody to bail me out, which was very helpful, that was very fast. Another important thing was that the curriculum they had collated, It was very well curated, I would say which is very different from a lot of other platforms, so I believe that was one of the biggest highlights about the course. So mentorship is one of the USP's that	27	Education	PT1M15S	75	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sT7oJ6vQhVU/maxresdefault.jpg		2954	17	2	0	1

I am a data scientist at Walmart labs for the past one year. I have been working in the field OF data science for around 3-4 years now, in this video, I will be briefing you about what a daily routine in my life looks like. Before I proceed, I would want you guys to subscribe to Springboard India to stay updated with the upcoming interviews. So before I go into my routine, I would want to cover what data science is, because a lot of people have asked me this. So, there are a bunch of definitions going around saying that data science is a study of data or it’s a science that goes behind studying data but for me, data science is leveraging data to solve real-world problems and that is how I treated my daily life as well. Now moving on to what is a data scientist? So a data scientist is someone who can actually solve problems given a set of data but that doesn’t really end there, so a data scientist is someone who can actually do the end to end deliverable from taking the requirements from the product to actually looking into data, coming up with the model and at the end delivering the solution which is readily usable in production. So now going into my daily routine of what do I do, so the whole data science problem-solving process starts from us interacting with the product to get the requirements correctly, post that we sort of review the requirements documents which they have given us then we go on an exploratory phase where we look at our databases to see what all data we have, what data can we use and a lot of time also goes in cleaning the data set because as we know the real-world data sets are way different from toy data sets, the values are not very clean, so big amount of time goes into this. Then we go into the feature engineering step where we look around what features can we use, what features can we create, what features actually help us solve the problem, then we sort of start with our modeling procedure. Now we try out a couple of models which we think are going to be useful in solving this problem. Once we are done with the model then we sort of go into the evaluation phase which I think is a very important phase because now we have to evaluate it correctly, how our models are performing and we also have to make sure that this is the best we can do, so we do a couple of alterations on top of it so our model evolves iteratively. Once we are done with this, now comes the part where we have to present this to the product, in a way that they understand this whole procedure but not going into too much detail. So here a lot of data visualization, storytelling skills come in where we explain to them what we have done, how this model can be useful to them. Once that happens then we sort of taking this to production. Now taking this to production mean writing clear code, adding safety checks, making sure the code doesn’t really fail often and it runs on a daily basis to create out results.	27	Education	PT12M41S	761	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cp4EKu5qyW0/maxresdefault.jpg		5317	132	5	0	35

And they would know about various toolkits available, for instance, sci-kit learn or they would understand framework such as keras or tensorflow, for instance, and should be able to take up a project and formulate the right model for the particular problem at hand and be able to execute it. Many a time it is useful for them to know big data framework and execute algorithms at scale for example we used a lot of spark at Amazon. So typically a machine learning scientist and sometimes they are called data scientists so again as well know that the job titles are representative and we want to like talk about the most popular definition of them. machine learning engineer. The machine learning engineer also has a good understanding of machine learning tools that are used to solve problems and is someone who can make a machine learning pipeline end to end using various libraries again like the sci-kit learn or if you can use deep learning libraries for training like keras, tensorflow and so on. Someone who can built the end-to-end pipeline, deploy it and write maintainable code. So that’s a machine learning engineer. it could vary from just SQL to understand and make inferences from database, all the data that exists in database, to tools like excel and tableau, but often they also know a little bit of, they use predictive modelling, that’s machine learning and people tend to use Python and also R is very popular with data analysts. Data analysts are someone who are t skills such as data visualizations and data storytelling and are someone who can gather insights from data. about today is the data engineer data engineer ML algorithm or the model and what comes out of the ML model and how to handle that. So the data that an ML model uses resides in various sources. data engineer’s job is to collect all these data from various sources and clean this data and process this data, do ETL on it and give it in the appropriate format to the ML algorithm. building the data pipeline is what it’s called. And then out of the ML algorithm and do the right thing with it so that it can be consumed by the rest of the application.data engineers tend to be good programmers, they could use python, sometimes they even use JAVA, C++. big data technologies and often it is a HIVE and Hadoop	27	Education	PT14M43S	883	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ous4EtqOnaQ/maxresdefault.jpg		17021	259	8	0	32

One is figuring out what kind of learning do you like? Do you like to learn from a book or do you like watching videos? I like watching videos. When you’re watching videos are you taking notes? Those kinda things, figure out your learning curve, how are you going to do that. Second thing is, find more friends. You can find people in the forums, you can talk to them and see and have this kind of a community wherein you can go to; you can go to data science meetups and meet people who are also the same, following the same paths, struggling to learn, etc. Then the third thing is, you’re having people who have already gone through this. Have some mentors. I think that really helps a lot. Talking to them will make a lot more sense to you; you would also know where you’re going wrong and you can also say that this is the path I want to learn. There is going to be a lot of clarity which you’re going to get. And the fourth thing that I am going to say is this – Do not get stuck in theory. It has to be hands-on. Unless and until you run your first model, understand and run your first model, it’s ok even if it’s a blackbox, just run it. Even if you don’t understand python, just run it. Download a notebook and just run it on a Google Collab or whatever it is, but just run it. It’s OK. Be more hands-on. Only then you’ll learn a lot more. So, 3 things: Figure out the course, whatever you want to do; have a support structure of friends, forums, etc have couple of mentors or a mentor who is going to help you out and the fourth thing, Be HandsOn, do more projects. I would say that breaking into data science is just equivalent to breaking into software engineering for someone who does not have that kind of background. To split it down into atomic parts, I would say that you need to be passionate about that field, you need to get a strong hold of the basics, basic technical skills that you require for that field. Apart from that you should probably choose an industry in which you have an inherent interest. For example if you’re interested in Finance, you should look for roles in the financial industry as a data scientist. And apart from that you should have a knack of augmenting your knowledge regularly because it is an ever evolving field so everyday you have new research papers being published, the amazing research that is happening in the AI and the community. And there a new tools that you get to use for implementing your solutions. You should have that sort of curiosity and that sort of drive in you to learn something new each day and keep augmenting your knowledge. If you feel you identify with this kind of a skill set you’re on the right path of transitioning into data science. The thing people still have confusion that anyone can be a data scientist or not. So I will say anyone can be a data scientist. Even I'm mentoring one student, he has absolutely no background of maths and coding and he is doing fine, very good in the data science track.	27	Education	PT8M20S	500	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S8MmsBsGP-Q/maxresdefault.jpg		170317	3913	111	0	170

Today we have Sumit, who is a data scientist at Walmart Labs and we will be talking about Sumit’s journey into Data Science. What makes someone a hirable data scientist or what makes someone hirable? So, There are a lot of parameters you can judge this on but I will go with my personal preferences when I am taking certain interviews. So, what basically is important for me is clarity on fundamentals, that is the most important thing because see data science is a very vast field and you cannot expect anyone to know or just narrate me tell me algorithms or models you know, the more you know I will just hire you, that’s not the case and its growing day by day. So we do not or never actually expect people to actually know a certain set of algorithms or models for them to hire right. We actually just see what are the clarities on fundamentals. How clearly does he know the basic concepts, we also see how smart he is, what is his learning capabilities because we back that person given the fundamentals are clear that he will pick up whatever algorithms or models are there on the table. But if the fundamentals are not there, then basically I don’t think anybody has the time for in this whole IT world that we will just go back and teach the basics.	27	Education	PT2M7S	127	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jm0W1dkAUEo/maxresdefault.jpg		133627	109	7	0	11

Before that I hadn’t even heard of Springboard. So I joined up, okay let’s see what can be done. So he was like before you make a decision why don’t you get on a call with one of our mentors. So I got in touch with Chirasmita, she is a data scientist and I spoke to her and I expressed my concerns that I have been taking a lot of courses, what makes this course different? there will be guidance, this is like course. And then I moved on to Springboard website, I checked out the courses and really loved the kind of bases that it covered and also the fact that it also lets you choose the kind of specialisation towards the end. And that was it. I was so sold on that, I took a test and I got started with the program. I guess the main reason I would say why I joined Springboard would be course content was fantastic, a fact of guided mentorship and also the fact that there was also a career services help which give you know like job guarantee and stuff. And that is difficult, it’s not like the usual placements, it’s like a guidance that you have from mentors and your career counsellors across the entire course. That helps them get to know you, that helps you get to know yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses and overall that helps you in looking out for jobs once you finished the program. So my learning goal when I joined Springboard was to be able to understand and master the basics of data science. I went through the course curriculum and that seem to have everything from the very beginning to the end. And interestingly you know I discovered Springboard through Prashant on LinkedIn, so that was a very good start I would say and everything that he had promised then actually holds true even now. The kind of access that I got was very important for me and that I believe will help me go a long way in my career. So far my experience with Springboard has been fantastic in the sense that I had a good opportunity to interact with mentors. I had a good opportunity to receive any help if I have got stuck in any kind of technical trouble, there would probably be obviously somebody to bail me out, that was very helpful, that was very fast. Another important thing was that the curriculum they had collated, It was very well curated, I would say which is very different from a lot of other platforms, so I believe that was one of the biggest highlights about the course. So mentorship is one of the USP's that Springboard that you can possibly experience and it’s been very interesting for me because my mentor has been monumental in helping me figure out my career goals.	27	Education	PT8M4S	484	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zh6MlMsJZko/maxresdefault.jpg		1917	43	5	0	7

Why I think women need to get into data science or MLS because when you are trying to build these MLL algorithms, having just a singular point of view, like having just a male point of view will sort of introduces an inherent bias in those algorithms. For example, when you are trying to process language, a lot of people would attribute an engineer to be a guys and a doctor to be a female, teacher to be a female but you need to sort of you know get out of that bias. So having more women in your workforce will sort of reduce that bias and diversity will help your teams to progress and have different and alternative point of views when you are trying to sort problems. For example, at my job I was analysing e-commerce data which belong to a personal care website. Now most of the users of that particular website are females. So if you have only males in your team, you would probably not have as good points or as good insights about a product should be used, what you expect from a product and that kind of knowledge is actually important when you are building models. And in the same way if you are having, you are focusing on a male dominant industry, you need some male perspective as well. So we need to normalise that and that is why I feel l like diversity within data science is very important.	27	Education	PT2M27S	147	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DTPg_KzdfGs/maxresdefault.jpg		1374	42	6	0	1

Welcome Siddharth, it’s a pleasure to have you. So Siddharth having been at Target for 6.5 years now and having been a practising data scientist for so many years, what according to you is data science? And what would make someone successful in the field of data science if they are looking to enter into this field? Very good question Prashant and you know, at Springboard to all my mentees I have told this when they ask me what is data science and one of my mentees asked me how can I be successful in data science? I told him see, don’t look at data science just as a collection of some tools and some mathematical techniques. There is a famous doctrine that goes out you know that data science is a mixture of three things, your domain knowledge, your programming and your mathematics. But yes, this is there, everyone has that there are many data scientist out there who have the skills but why they are not successful because most of them they miss one thing that is the skill of thinking, critical thinking. I mean apart from these three things if I want to tell one thing that can differentiate between a good data scientist and bad data scientist and an average data scientist is the skill of critical thinking, thinking with your data and to all my mentees I say before doing anything, before you even write a program, think of implementing a model or fitting a model to a data, think, ask these two questions, why..why.. why and so what! These two questions, why and so what. So one of my mentee, he was giving this test at Springboard DSC Prep Test. So first time he kind of could not make it through, he could not pass all the tests and then he came to me. I said, did you apply this framework of why, so what and then started coding? And did you break the problem into components? Then he said no sir, I didn’t do it. I said, next time when you take the test, do it! I explained to him, see, if you always ask yourself why I am solving this problem, what is the pain point here and if I solve this problem, so what! How is a user going to benefit from it? If you ask these questions and get answers to yourself right, in the bigger canvas you know where in the bigger picture your solution is going to fit and how can we integrate it to the main picture you know, the larger picture. And that mentee came to me, like I told this him on Sunday, on Wednesday he send a mail and say sir I have passed the test, thank you so much. Your thing of before writing a code ask why and so what has helped me a lot. So, in order to become successful, I would say the most important thing a data scientist should have, along with all these set of tools and technique is thinking, thinking with your data, critical thinking. Asking this why and so what often. When you are in a meeting, you should not take orders, I mean data scientists are not supposed to be waiters, they don’t take orders, they are the think tanks, they are supposed to be think tank because companies depend on them. They say something, companies say, okay they must have thought about it. So you know, you should be owning your decision. So that comes only when you are thinking about that.	27	Education	PT4M15S	255	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcezM_1ECz0/maxresdefault.jpg		2268	93	1	0	8

Ok so now that you said that anyone, you know if they are willing to work hard and if they have the passion to acquire the skill, they can do it right? Does this also mean that there is or you know to frame it another way, is there any prerequisite required to learn or acquire the skills the skill of an AI engineer? Is there a prerequisite in terms of your education background or and is there a prerequisite in terms of your education background? I think yes, you can, right. The thing is your domain knowledge also helps. Let's say for example you have been working in finance, right, but you do not know software coding that much, you can still learn AI. AI is not just about coding, it's about how you understand the model and how are you going use that model as a tool to get to your solution or to get to better answers, etc. right. So, if you have good domain knowledge it can help you. If you are a software engineer for a few years or you are just a fresher you are just coming out, you can still do it. So its a different kind of skill set that is needed, there is no prerequisite saying that I have to do these 10 steps and only then you know even look at the first course or first video that will make me an AI engineer or a data scientist. I think it’s not true. I think there is no prerequisite per say. See, for example, yes the market might look at people who have a formal education but what if, I mean when I am interviewing candidates I have seen that if they don’t have much experience, I ask them conceptual questions, have you got the concept right, how do you use it as a tool. If you are an engineer, right, let’s say you have a lot of experience as an engineer, then you must be good at problem-solving, right! And that will come as a wonderful tool for you to do it. AI is another concept to be learned and whatever knowledge you already had, it works. So, I just want to give an example, so there is something called a fast.AI, ya, you know wherein doctors participate. There are also some course I have seen in Bangalore itself where there are people from finance, they don’t even know the basics of software coding who come and said that they are really scared about what they do but I have seen them work on models and bring out solution within like a week or two, right. It not like they have really worked hard at it or they have just like mugged up books and everything of all sorts. They were just there, they understood the concepts, they just had this confidence that they could do it, whatever they wanted to do they could get there. So I don’t think you need a prerequisite, I think its more about your passion to learn and you can get there.	27	Education	PT3M18S	198	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-wlzKwU-DGE/maxresdefault.jpg		11096	157	15	0	15

Today we have Abhishek Periwal with us. Abhishek is a machine learning data scientist at Flipkart and today he will be talking about how he got started in data science, how his journey has been and any advice that he has for new people who are looking to start in data science. Can you run us through some of the problems, projects that you handled while at Flipkart? I majorly worked in landing industry, so one of the problems like it is traditional problem is which is each industry is working on is predicting whether the customer if we are giving a particular credit line or credit product to the customer, will he payback or will she payback or not. So that is like one of the problems which we are solving. So how it is different in Flipkart, the thing is, the data other NBFCs banks are having the credit history of the customer, so we are solving it with a different dimension. We are looking into the purchase history of the customer and we are solving according to his budget behavior, his or her activity on Flipkart. So, it starts from feature engineering first, you have to create the features which could be relevant. Now it is about EV testing because you don’t know the past of the person, whether he is a good customer or not. So you have to choose an experimental segment, experiment on that, then you build a model which is biased then you create another model to remove the biases of the previous model. So things keep iterating and going in a better and better way. So this is one of the projects and projects which I am working on is still in the development phase. I hope we will have a good product by the end of this year.	27	Education	PT2M12S	132	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiHZZIZ-bpE/maxresdefault.jpg		5987	119	4	0	4

My name is Neeraj Agrawal. I'm a senior data scientist at Walmart. In today’s video, I'm going to talk about What is data science? What is a data scientist? And then how to get a good job in a great company? And finally I’m going to talk about What is data science salary? How much a data scientist can earn? So, what is data science? In a layman term, something to learn from data is data science. A guy who learns from data can learn from data is a data scientist. What data science comprises of? I think that you need a mathematics background. You should be a good statistician. You should have a good knowledge of statistics. You should be good at machine learning. Other than that, taking data science space as a whole. We have deep learning experts, in deep learning we have experts in NLP(Natural Language Processing) and we have experts in computer vision. company always looks that one should have good programming skills. It can be in python, it can be java or any other language and you should be good at making algorithms. Companies also look for someone who has a good mathematical background If somebody gave you a research paper to read can you read those papers.the reason we need a person who knows a little bit of probability and statistics. And finally, he should be knowing the basics of machine learning algorithms. The question is how to apply for the data scientists’ job?For instance, if you are not getting a project in your company then you have to build your programming skills very strong, work on some of the projects like Kaggle competition or as a part of some courses and then you can bring your potential on the table. Finally, let’s talk about the data scientists’ salaries. This is a hot topic & one thing that I have observed, people are moving into this field because of salary. There are three categories of people, the first one is who is starting from scratch. It's always good to enter into this field as early as possible because definitely you will have to compete with the person who is data scientist for 10 years and you have domain expertise of 10 years in your field then you have a 2 years of experience in a data science field and to match that salary it will be little tough but also data scientist salary depends on other factors like which companies you are targeting like there are some big companies & some startups and also some mid-range companies are there . Based on company you are targeting your salary will depend, so you cannot say that you have 5 years of experience - I should get a certain amount of salary but as a whole if you are a fresher or someone with 2-3 year of experience then you can expect in the range from 10-20 LPA or something like that and if you are really a bright guy and you are really working on data structures algorithms and all the things I am talking about you can expect little more and if you have 5-10 year experience it means you are a gem, so you can expect in the range of 30-40 LPA and more.	27	Education	PT11M44S	704	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qwGnrjkQq98/maxresdefault.jpg		264749	5250	187	0	551

Here is what she said: Hi, My name is Chirasmita. I have been working in Data Science field for 5 years now. I started with my career in Healthcare Insurance and moved to People’s Analytics, Semiconductor Analytics, Healthcare R&D. Now I have moved to a smaller role where I am trying to set up Data Science teams for different start-ups across Bangalore. The journey has been pretty rewarding for me. It has basically stemmed out from fear of missing out, I did not want to go into a nightly role when I was graduating from an engineering background. So, this is when IBM was launching into Big Data and this was just a catch phrase and it just got me and I wanted to know more about the same. I just went for the Grace Hopper’s Celebration Scholarship. This is when it started when I pursued a Yahoo researcher and he took me as an intern and we built a recommender system as a part of my internship. Post this, I got my first job offer with Opera Solutions which was into Healthcare Consulting. I think that I have been Challenged to work on day to day basis on various aspects of the problem using text-based data, noisy data, and using a lot of imaging problem. So, learning to apply, adapt and see where the industry is heading been pretty challenging. It is basically like you always need to be on your toes, you are in a start-up environment all the time. I think that adrenaline rush to address a problem also have a foresight to see that how your business is actually ending up with a lot of value out of it, how you are saving time, how you are saving on your revenue this is something which gives you a lot of satisfaction because you see that your work impacts a huge amount of people. So, I prioritize to work on an important problem which really impacts a huge set of people across India.

Here is what he said: So, this is my approach when a person comes to me that is the basics clear to you, in terms of all the things which we need for machine learning. Then the basic machine learning which could be regression, random forest, neural networks, deep networks, etc all of these are tools and understanding of them is really important. People should be able to code them as well and doing them as a black box is okay to start with but that’s not the end goal. You should be able to code them, use them, manipulate them as per your need. Though there are tools like Tensor Flow and Keras where you may not have to go deeper and code them but still have an understanding of the system is extremely important when you want to go forward in the system down the line. So, this is what typically I expect when a candidate comes or a student comes to me in terms of what exactly they need to take different steps when they want to transit into Machine Learning or Data Science platforms.

Here is what he said: Now when the students come and ask what are exact things which they need to do, if they want to do the transition into Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence. The most important thing we need to understand is having an analytical mind. Analytical mind means there are two perspectives which I typically look at when I look at the scenario and overall system. People treat machine learning tools as a black box. The second set of people are the one who knows what machine learning tool is doing and try to work over it so that they can improve the performance of the system for a particular task. When I look at first kind of people, for them it's like there is a tool, there is a library, they will use it and they will have certain performances. The major issue which is happening in these kinds of setups when people are just using machine learning as a black box, they do not have an idea when they want to improve something and how it should be improved. They may be following others but they do not have the analytical mind which is required to be brought to understand the problem better and then solve it in a better way. Here, the limitation of the tool becomes the limitation of the person. On the other hand, when you are having an analytical mind what you may do is, you may try to open up the tool and you will try to understand what is going inside that tool. And as soon as we start talking about that then there are certain skills which are needed. Some of these skills are like a good background in mathematics. When we call about mathematics it is typically around algebra, calculus, probability, etc. Computer Science is also very important when we want to do something because we may have an algorithm of something but it needs to be coded into a machine, into a computer so that decisions can be made. The third thing which is important is how to manipulate this data because the data which is getting accumulated in different organizations. The major issue which we see is maybe the data has not been collected with any purpose. If the purpose of the data was not very sure when it was getting collected, there is a possibility that data in its raw form cannot be absorbed by the machine. So, now three parts one is on the education side- what are the basic things which you should be doing, second is on computer science part where programming is important, the third part is how to manipulate this data- how to collect this data and things which are related to data. Now the fourth component is also evolving because machine learning has moved to space where we don’t want to look at a very small amount of data and do a very corner type of job. We are looking at millions and millions of data points which needs to be crunched. There are specialized tools which can do this type of data processing because data is flowing in high velocity and it needs to be dealt with in the same fashion. So, there are systems which are like battle processing systems, Hadoop. MapReduce. There kind of different systems which have evolved over the years to help the Data Scientists to crunch these big data sources much more easily. The fifth component which comes into the picture, which is the recent phenomenon, especially in the neural network domain where we are talking about the GPUs which can process huge amount of data into a deep network kind of philosophy which I was mentioning a few minuted back. All of this becomes something important when a person wants to take a plunge into a machine learning system. Now some of these things are basics, basics in the sense as I was mentioning, though I could be a computer programmer, there are certain libraries that are existing and I work with certain databases. But this is not the definition of machine learning or AI scientists. Typically this approach can get us some distance. The main thing is that do I understand the logic in the algorithm and in the maths behind it. So that when it comes to improving something I know exactly needs to be done. Do I know how to manipulate the data? The rest of the systems which are like on top of Hadoop, MapReduce and other processing systems along with this the GPUs which comes on the hardware sides.	27	Education	PT5M17S	317	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9IHeWgQhLo/maxresdefault.jpg		363	13	0	0	0

Here is what he said: Hi, I am Hemant Mishra. I am Head of Applied Research at Swiggy. Almost for the last 22 years, I am with research in different areas of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. What do I feel about AI/ML? So, there is a whole history which had happened in the last 30-40 years, and the field has evolved over several years. Initially, for every application which we look at, Machine Learning was not the term which was used. We were looking at a different application like automatic speech recognition or speaker recognition and there were tools which were specific for each of these applications. When we look at automatic speech recognition, HMM’s and dynamic programming these were the different things which were getting used to solving the problem. So, for speaker recognition, we had a Gaussian mixture model and the things built on the top of it. Over the years what was realized by different scientists who were working in the academia that the underline phenomenon in each of them, if there is a certain kind of signal which are sitting at the bottom of the model and they need to be model in certain ways. Then slowly the field started evolving and we started looking at the different kind of systems which we may be seeing now. For instance HMMs is used for sequence model and sequences could be part of let's say computer form coming from computer vision they can come from other areas like a speech. In the recent past the way that field has evolved, artificial neural networks which were there for a different task like categorization, interpolation, and different other things, they evolved and with a huge amount of data, we start getting available to the different systems. We started looking at deep learning or deep networks. So, when a question comes that What exactly are we doing in many of these fields? The most basic thing which I tell is, we are trying to identify different patterns and these patterns when we want to identify by looking at it; humans do patterns identification all the time. For example, I need to catch a bus and there is a bus which is standing in front of me. I will be looking at the number which is there on the bus to understand whether this bus is going to the place where I want to go or not. So, if you really look at it, I am trying to do the segmentation of the scene where I am looking at the bus then in the bus I am trying to look at exactly the place where the numbers are appearing that what is the bus number and then maybe the other information which will be associated with the same. So, on a day to day basis we do these tasks but think of it as how much information we can process as a human being or how much information we can retain as a human being? So let’s say when we go further and data starts becoming more and more, typically there is a data overload on us and we can not process data beyond a certain limit in a human capacity. Now, this is the place if we look at it machine overload, the problem was resolved to a certain extent by Google, giving us a ranked list of outputs in response to a particular query. When we go through with these responses, we feel that the information need of a person is getting met out. How this information need is getting met out and how the ranking is happening? This is basically what Machine Learning is happening in the background.	27	Education	PT7M55S	475	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IpCF5e5D3iM/maxresdefault.jpg		737	21	0	0	0

It has been a couple of months since I have joined Springboard. My journey so far has been amazing, things that I am getting to learn from the mentors, career coaches, and the Springboard team are really helpful. So, three things that amazed me are as follows. First of all, Mentors, Mentors are like your teachers and friends at the same time. They are always there to support you. Whatever you do, you can always expect their guidance to follow, let it be in things you do, etc. Also, this enables you to understand the expectations of the recruiters in the industry because then again you get to interact with someone who is already a part of this industry and is your mentor. This is helping me to get insights about what exactly is happening out there in the industry which I really fancy. Second is, job guarantee, the special aspect of job guarantee which I like the most is basically it is not campus recruitment, Springboard’s Career Coaches actually train you and make you capable to find any type of job in the industry for example Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc. So, overall they help us to realize the difference between different job roles in the industry which is a concern most of us have while entering into this industry. The third is, how Springboard members connect with their learners. The human touch that is prime in Springboard’s course where they establish a friendship with each and every single one of us, also assuring us that they are with us in all circumstances. Furthermore, giving us a sense that no matter where we start, we will eventually end up with our desired job role.	27	Education	PT2M	120	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fQI4YIKDbsE/maxresdefault.jpg		4259	12	0	0	2

The Mentor-Student relationship is one of the unique feutures that Springboard provides, compared to the various other online courses available in the market. Adding on to this, for an instance whenever we are studying a new topic, we do not have any guidance (via mentor) which can help us in clearing up our thought process. The mentorship access made me choose Springboard. The mentor helps the learner to build a strong platform where you can easily build up your goals and skillsets which can help you build your career down the line. Furthermore, I would like to add that Springboard is a must go for someone who is seeking a career in the field of Data Science. Cheers to Springboard team.

I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Pitney Bowes India Pvt Ltd. So, from the beginning Springboard was standing out from the crowd. The reason I feel this is from my past experience. Previously, I have done more than 20 MOC’s and every time I use to do MOC, there was always a bridge that I had to cross between what I was learning and what I was going to use because human tendency is, you tend to forget. However, Springboards course includes a well-curated curriculum, this is definite. Apart from this, they provide us with 1:1 Mentoring sessions which help us to Learn from veterans of the Industry. Furthermore, when we belong from an engineering background, we usually are unaware of the career perspectives and a Mentor can always guide us in the right direction, how to network, how career perspectives are directly related to our conversation with others in the field, how to know the industry pattern along with its requirements, plus how existing people in the industry can help us to grow. These are the most motivating and unique factors in Springboard’s offerings. If they continue with the same way, not only owning the students but also coping with us through the sessions and regular interactions through Teaching Assistance, Mentoring, etc which will certainly help everyone in the long run.	27	Education	PT1M37S	97	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kXNgXgfyRJA/maxresdefault.jpg		20440	12	1	0	0

So, I think there are a lot of different types of career opportunities for people interested in Data Science. It can be Data Science Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Scientist, Data Analyst, Business analyst, etc related roles. There is often confusion on which role to pick. People usually say “I have come from a certain background” etc and are not sure which part to take. I think in this process a mentor can help. A mentor is someone who can help you figure out what opportunities to pursue given a particular background and what is the course of action to reach there. While a lot of Data so available online to pick up Data Science, mentorship even helps to understand in keeping track of progress and get a high level. Let's say you are confused about what is the kind of projects that you want to do. If you want to land in a certain kind of job and even what kind of domain you want to pick based on your experience. So, I think having a mentor, having that little bit of advice takes you a long way in making the right decisions.

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP So, today I will be briefly talking about AI and ML. Who can become an AI/ML Engineer? AI/ML- you can think of it as a marriage of some parts of Computer Science, Software Engineering, etc. Machine Learning is basically where you apply algorithms to data without thinking about pre-coding the logic and this is being applied in diverse areas in the industry and the scope is immense from a career perspective, be it in Health Care, Retail, Software Engineering, Information Technology, and even automation so the scope with regard to job and career is immense. About who can become an AI/ML Engineer. Well, if you have some background in Software Engineering like writing codes, be it in JAVA, Python, or any other programming language, in fact, you can typically learn these skills because what you need to upskill that is a different paradigm of how to apply the algorithm of data and make them learn from the data so that it can improve over time and solve real-world problem like trying to predict the stock market, trying to predict device failure, anomaly detection, maybe even cancer prediction. So, the scope is immense. Let’s say even if you don’t have a Software Engineering background. If you can upskill yourself into writing some kind of programming code with regard to Python, JAVA, etc. You can pretty much simultaneously dive in ML and maybe Deep Learning.	22	People & Blogs	PT1M42S	102	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oj4xGakhK9o/maxresdefault.jpg		254	3	0	0	0

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP So, the intent which went behind in building the Springboard curriculum for the AI/ML career track is that you focus on some different aspect starting from what is the key tools which Data Scientist and ML Engineers needs these days and how do you typically distinguish from Data Science and ML Engineering. So, basically, the idea is you need to know a fair bit of not only, How to build the Machine Learning algorithm but also how do you actually deploy into production. How are these models actually being used in the real world? So, that is where you need to gain skills like, how do you deploy something once, and can deploy it anywhere in logic. Also, trying to know different aspects of Machine Learning starting from Linear Models, diving into non-linear models and deep learning. How are neural networks different from the regular Machine Learning algorithms. Once again for all these skills typically we have some case studies based approaches where you learn about how to apply whatever you have learned in specific areas like Natural Language Processing because text data and unstructured text data is like 80% of volume in different enterprises. So, that is one of the aspects where you learn to apply these things to Natural Language Processing based on used cases like sentiment analysis and also we focus on computer vision where you can focus on different case studies like predicting malaria using Deep Learning, Self-driving cars, etc. So, the intent of this curriculum is to give you an end to end approach starting from knowing the basics of statistics, Machine Learning, diving deeper into Deep Learning. Furthermore, how to deploy these models in production. You get to do an end to end capstone project covering all these aspects where you not only just build a model but also design a complete Machine Learning architecture and scale it up and deploy.	22	People & Blogs	PT2M12S	132	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Wujpw9QVGo/maxresdefault.jpg		143	5	0	0	0

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP Hi, I am Saurabh. I have been working in the Data Science space for about 10 years now. I primarily deal with technology, transportation, telecommunication, and retail. Who should learn Data Science? It really somebody who is curious, has a little bit of quantitative aptitude and is willing to learn new things. So, if you enjoy learning, if you enjoy finding facts, if you enjoy being a pseudo-detective who is trying to find answers using data you should be a Data Scientist. My own journey into Data Science has been interesting and I have found my way through all kind of different industries, exposure, background, and roles that I took. So, it is not true that you need to be a Computer Scientist or Ph.D. in Maths to really be a part of a Data Science conversation. The fundamental key is for you to be really curious. I am an Electrical Engineer by education, I did an MBA in Marketing and Strategies, does that make a Computational Scientist? Not Really. As I keep saying that the key code driving fact is that you need to be a logical thinker. You should be able to approach a problem from first principles and structure them in a meaningful way. Beyond that languages like Python are making it easier for people who come from a very little background in programming to really go out there and experience and try things. Frankly speaking, there are other platforms like Rapidminor that are for relatively simple pieces of analysis even make language a redundant. What really matters is How curious are you? How interested are you in learning about the Data or the fact or the Behaviour that you are interested in.

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP Hi everyone, My name is Sandeep. I work as a Data Scientist in Myntra. So, I think post completion of the Springboard course there are a lot of things that need to be done. This course will give an idea of what kind of projects are there, what type of topics need to learn, etc. Try to build your portfolio once you have completed the course in order to start participating in Kaggle competitions, etc. Generally, you do not get the opportunity to define the business problem because it is already defined but you get a platform to solve the complete problem. You clean and prepare the data so that a model can be formed. After this, you get to try a lot of things like different models, etc. The most important thing is that in kernels or the codes written by other’s along with this you get to learn from the discussion forum. The Second thing which is very important, wherever you are working, you know in and out of it. You know the business of the company, you have access to their data. In case if it is possible you should talk to the Data Science team who is working and building the Machine Learning models. You should approach them and discuss what type of projects they are working on because this will help you get the data so that you can try working on your own project. Also, you can speak with your manager and look for internal transfer. This is very critical because I feel it is easier to have an internal transition as compared to looking for a position in any other organization. The reason being you already are aware of the business, you are comfortable with the model building along with all the Data Science skills which are required. These are a few tips that I can give to someone who is looking for a transition. I mean definitely post completion of the course you should try participating in some real-life competitions like Kaggle, Hackerearth, etc. Furthermore, I want to add if you are a JAVA developer or a database developer, you have some skills that can be transferred to Data Science skills. For instance, there is a start-up who wants to build an Artificial Intelligence product and they are looking for someone who can build their User Interface, handle the backend, etc. So, they are looking for skilled people who know JAVA, Machine Learning Algorithms, etc. For someone who is experienced, after completing the course, you should chase such job roles because that is easy and you can expect a good salary hike. To conclude, I would suggest, one should always try to transfer their skills into Data Science roles. Finally, I would like to wish All the best to all the candidates who have been enrolled in this course.	22	People & Blogs	PT2M41S	161	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/07PlterdGdM/maxresdefault.jpg		328	6	0	0	2

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP Hey Everyone, I am Pratik. I am a learner at Springboard. Springboard’s Mentorship program is something that has intrigued me to take this course. Mentorship is something which I was specifically looking for, for quite some time, because independently I have tried studying bits and pieces of Machine Learning. I did participate in Kaggle competitions. But the real push came when I met the mentor. So, the top three things that I can put together about Springboard course is first, the mentor has given me the perspective on how end to end Data Science process works rather than while individual learning I only used to focus on Machine Learning algorithms part, reason being we do not deal into data grabbing and deployment side of things which is exactly done in the industry. The mentor has helped me in building that perspective. Secondly, the bloggers, Maniar times it happened that I used to build some Machine Learning model which will either run for too long or the kernel would disconnect, etc would occur and every time I would need an expert who can review my code and guide me on what point is missing. This is something I should know and take care of. Thirdly, I would say the resources because the mentor also has been a learner at some point in their life let's say around 8-10 years back. So, that part is very important. I still remember when I was looking forward to reading something on the recommender system. So, rather than a general habit to go back to the book where I read from scratch, the mentor helped me in a precise manner giving me a chapter of the book specifying the important topic to be read for the recommender system. So, this is something I won’t get without the mentor’s guidance. Thank You!	22	People & Blogs	PT2M28S	148	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dYR8dgEFb3U/maxresdefault.jpg		753	14	2	0	0

Over the last 6+ years we have served 10K+ learners in 80+ countries and now offering job guarantee programs in Data Science and AI/ML in India. Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP Hi, I'm Matangi and I have 15+ years of experience in Data Science. I started my career in GE Consumer Finance and currently, I am leading a Data science team at PhonePe. I have around 10+ patent grants in the area of customer service, indoor positioning and user profile with Data Science as a background. I am a passionate person when it comes to Data and technology. I would love any day to build models that could build a final smile on consumers face or add some extra money to a company. There is this one question that I keep getting asked, people with like 10 plus years of experience reach out to me via LinkedIn or various forums ask me this question on “How do I move to Data Science?” So, I will answer frankly first, you really need to look at if you want to move to this field. There is a lot of buzz and hype around these things and it's not too glamorous as it may seem. In a regular job you got to do a lot of things and suddenly after 10 plus years of experience getting into a new field like this will be difficult. So, there are a lot of ways to cover and if you are really passionate about it then yes. Second thing is in order to make a smooth career transition instead of trying to be only a Data Scientist, there are other opportunities in this field for eg if you are from the product management area, you could be a product manager working with a Data science team or you could be in a consulting company where you are facing clients and you have a technical team working for you, there could be technical accounts manager area where you could shift. But if you are clear on the fact that you want to sit with Data and you want to build models then you should be also willing to give up on the years of experience that you have gained over time because your past experience cannot be valid to Data Science. Of course, then again it depends on where you come from for eg if you were in a Data Analytics kind of career where you were working closely with numbers, etc and from there you want to shift to Machine Learning so, a shift will be pretty smooth and hence some of your past experience could count. But let’s say you belong to a sales background because I do get asked this question that people from a non-technical background want to make a shift to data science and this is an uphill task. One other way lets say you definitely want to move to Data Science and you willing to do required hard work in this case, first of all, you should see if there are opportunities in your current organization after you have acquired the needed skills. These skills can be gained over an online course like Springboard etc. It is structured learning out there post which you get your skills, you have done some Kaggle kind of hackathons or any other hackathons in India through which you know you are completely out there, you are aligned to what you want in which case try to see if you can make a shift within your organisation. Approach the concerned person in your organization and ask them to consider your profile. Initially, you can work on some trial project to understand if that profile suits you or else you can move on. If this doesn't work out, you can try to see if you can do some real-world Data Science kind of thing, you can build your portfolio and network possibly in an early stage start-up and check if you can make a breakthrough where you can pick up your pace and start your journey. Another option is you can take a freelance project parallel to your usual job and present those as a portfolio of the projects that you want your potential recruiter to look at. But having said all this if it is not for my first option which is moving into your current area of expertise but working with data and Data Science teams if that doesn't work then shift in your current organization if that also doesn't work then prefer to go out possibly meeting people, trying to socialize and build your potential set of projects. So, this would be my three prolonged approaches for someone who wants to make a shift to Data Science.	22	People & Blogs	PT4M26S	266	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XDMVvvPgKT4/maxresdefault.jpg		396	4	0	0	0

I have been asked to answer this question- Why is it important to take a course when you are transitioning into Data Science or Machine Learning. From my experience, I can put this into two points. The first point is when you are doing a course it helps you bring structure. It helps you approach a problem in a structured fashion. The second important point is, something that even I have found useful when I have taken courses in the past is that when you are taking a course, you come across with certain keywords. If you find these keywords relevant to the problem that you are trying to solve, you Google it and come across with the latest literature or the Software and you try to use the same and implement it on the problem that you are trying to solve.

Apply here: http://bit.ly/2GWaEEP Hi Everyone, My name is Nayan Gupta. I am a Data Scientist at Belong.co. Belong is an outbound hiring platform which helps companies discover and engage candidates to hire them. I have graduated from IIT-Kharagpur in 2013 with a Master’s Degree in statistics and I have been working as a Data Scientist ever since. Coming to Data Science, Data Science is a multidisciplinary field which involves skills from Statistics, Software Engineering, Programming, Machine Learning, Probability, Communications, etc. When you combine these skills, the roles which come up are diverse. First I will talk about two roles Data Engineer and Infrastructure Engineer. So, these people typically do not do heavy data analysis but they are more of engineers who support data. Coming to Data Science. In Data Science there are three broad categories of roles, there is still confusion around the same but gradually some clarity is coming up. The first role is a Data analyst, these are the folks who are responsible for summarizing data using basic statistics, SQL queries, etc responsible for communicating this matrix with business owners and skills that typically used are R, Python, and basic statistics and they are hired in almost every company. The second role is more if a Data Science generalist which has more of Scientific rigour when compared to Data Analyst. The skills required in this job role are statistics, Machine Learning, programming, etc. the problem is that these people work on with typically recommender system, fraud detection, predicting sales, etc. Furthermore, companies do hire for these roles. The third role is of a Machine Learning Engineer which is very specific to product based companies where these people have a solid background of Software Engineering and additionally, they know Machine Learning so, the benefit is that they can put machine learning models into production. All these types of people collaborate with each other in order to derive business values.

What is the value of a mentor? A mentor is like a coach, he will guide you and will ensure that you are able to move along in the right direction with the right pace. Is Coach necessary? Well, even Sachin Tendulkar had a coach so it shows that even if you are very talented yourself, knowing the direction in which you should move is very important. An additional point is that a mentor generally tends to be embedded within the industry. So, they know what is happening in the industry. Even if you learn languages like Python, R, SQL, etc which I have mentioned in point one, you will not know what industry is doing unless you connect with a mentor.	22	People & Blogs	PT1M23S	83	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-npqzVCHI7Q/maxresdefault.jpg		354	9	5	0	0

According to me the biggest distinction of the springboard’s bootcamp is the mentor. I have told multiple people and I have also blogged about it. One does not really understand how important the mentor is and the difference they can make, until you become a part of a program like this. As a part of Springboard I did close to a dozen projects and some of them got me a lot of recognition. It is one of the reasons I made the shift. Prior to this program, I was involved with web development but I made a shift to Data Science when I saw the potential in me, with regard to data science. Springboard helped me realise that potential. One of my projects with springboard was converted into a book and it got published in 2018. The book was dedicated to my mentor and rightly so. They were also other things that you cannot possibly read in a book that springboard mentors help with; for instance, networking. Networking is a very essential component of the springboard experience, it helps me to find data scientist all around the world; gain recognition for my work, and also land of few interviews. Thanks to the Springboard Data Science Career track, I have been approached by half-dozen companies. I have three job offers with me. I have the liberty to choose where I want to go. I only have Springboard to thank for that.	22	People & Blogs	PT1M46S	106	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xUsaNRuTYY/maxresdefault.jpg		653	19	1	0	6

The easy answer to who Data Science is for and who should go and do it is that basically everybody uses it, consumes it and practices it to some extent. We are all born statisticians and we learn from experience which is pretty much what machines do and precisely, the phenomenon when it plays out in the commercial world, in the real world. If you want to be on top of things then Data Science is the right path for you. So, I do not think there is any straightforward rule of thumb which distinguishes people who are fit for Data Science against the ones who are not. But definitely, it is good to have certain skills and these are all skills that can be learned easily. There is nothing inherent or nobody is born with a particular set of skills that distinguishes them as a Data Scientist. In general, I can add that ability to think in a structured and the analytical way is the only skill that you have to exercise. In fact, it’s not even a skill, I would say that it’s a habit. It is similar to working out. It’s a muscle, regularly you exercise it, the stronger it becomes. So, all the things that are required for Data Science including analytical thinking can be learned. For an instance, if you went back to my school and told my Mathematics teacher that I was doing applied statistics or mathematics for a living, she will not believe you because I was bad at Maths. But then again, I have learned this the hard way that mathematics, statistics, programming, etc, all of this is not innate, the more you practice, the more you learn and the better you get at it. It is a habit, not a skill. So, anybody who gets into the right set of habits is fit for Data Science job.	22	People & Blogs	PT2M22S	142	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sNEAoaD7ahI/maxresdefault.jpg		1353	41	1	0	5

As far as mentorship is concerned, I have noticed that people who study Data Science, tend to get lonely. There are few people who are interested in the same problem as you are in, there are few people who are studying the same material as you are and there are very few people who share the same goal in your family, organization and your friends. So, just having somebody to talk to, helps and I think that this is the biggest role a Mentor can play. Like I keep repeating you can only learn Data Science by doing things and Mentors have done things. You can always learn Data Science from their experience. Of course, everybody makes mistakes and that is the best way to learn but you don’t have to keep making mistakes, you can always have someone who you can count on, to guide you in the right direction plus the focus on one to one mentorship that I have seen here at Springboard is very valuable. If I have had someone who was a dedicated mentor to me, I think I would have been in a very different place in my life.	22	People & Blogs	PT1M26S	86	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kjGGlXhWzF4/maxresdefault.jpg		395	11	0	0	0

I have seen Data Scientists coming from various backgrounds like economics, physics, Computer Science, etc. How do you make a transition into Data Science? It depends on what your background is, what you need to see is unlike some other pathways in the Information Technology side of things, Data Science requires a much more inquisitive open approach to how you look at various aspects, for example, you need to be a little bit more explanatory and curious about things which will help you a successful transition. While you are trying to get into Data Science one pillar of this industry is learning however other pillar which is very useful is to have a guidance or mentorship because it's not something that can easily be taught by a textbook or just by looking at various course videos or lectures, which is something that is essential but above and beyond that if somebody can guide your process, somebody who you can bounce idea off or somebody who can take you around the twists and turns, can accompany your journey into Data Science.

I am a Senior Data Scientist at Brillio. I started with my career as an Application Developer in IBM. A few months in Accenture, post that in Harmond. My entry in Data Science happened in the year 2014. I still remember the first time when a senior member from my team approached me and explained about the Titanic data set, the Titanic problem. She said, “I can predict if you would have survived the Titanic crash”. I just laughed out on her face but she was damn serious about it, but then I asked her how is it even possible. This is when she started explaining to me what Machine Learning and Data Science is all about. So, this kind of piqued my interest in this field of Data Science and Machine Learning. I was into DotNet back then where I had my deliverables, projects, etc. But then in my heart I was convinced that I should be doing this, even if I do not succeed, I wanted to try it and wanted to find out if it will work out for me. That is when I decided and started putting my efforts in learning ‘R language’, I have a pretty good programming background. I am from Computer Science Engineering. I went 10 years back in my career to revise Mathematics, Statistics, Fundamentals of Calculus and Linear Algebra, etc. So, believe me, it was not an overnight job. It took me almost 1 year to start thinking like a Data Scientist, Looking at Data and wondering on how a Data Scientist will look at Data in order to get things. Finally, I was lucky enough to get an opportunity within my company on a project where I started getting involved in the team meetings, etc. At some point when I was able to convince my Manager that I could go further in this field.	22	People & Blogs	PT2M18S	138	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KHw9CUQmKQc/maxresdefault.jpg		1150	28	0	0	2
