While this reputation is not deserved, nevertheless we sometimes write code that runs slowly for one reason or another. The process of profiling allows us to identify speed bottlenecks in our functions, while benchmarking allows us to compare the speed of alternative approaches. Let’s dig into R’s profiling and benchmarking tools and learn some tips for speeding up our code. **Speaker**: Adam Austin Adam Austin received his M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of California, Davis in 2014. Now living in the Chicago area, he works as a data scientist and manager at Allstate Insurance where he builds predictive models, coordinates the Allstate R User Group, writes R packages to improve the quality of life, and trolls the Python message boards. His spare time is largely consumed by wrangling three children, but he also enjoys bicycling, hunting, indoor rock climbing, and hipster coffee. He misses California daily. **Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&A) Title: Non-exhaustive list of lesser used base R features Abstract: Demonstration of several lesser known R features, including special subsetting rules, infix replacement functions, and the logic behind the base plotting paradigm. Each feature will be explored by constructing a few toy examples as well as presenting their possible use cases in the real world. **Speaker**: Karolis Koncevičius Karolis Koncevičius works as a researcher at the institute of Biotechnology in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he uses R to analyse large genomic datasets. He also teaches a course about biomedical data analysis at the Vilnius University and has authored and co-authored a few R packages: 'matrixTests', 'annmatrix', 'basetheme', 'inops', 'DiscoRhythm'. **Code of Conduct**: https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct **Schedule** 6:40 open zoom 6:50-7:30 Talk1 7:30-8:00 Talk2 ~8:30 Virtual Social **LA R Users Group** Invite yourself to our Slack group: https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/ Ask us any questions by email: larusers@gmail.com Find our previous talks on GitHub: https://github.com/laRusers/presentations Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers Check out more events: https://laocr.org/ ***** DON'T BE SHY ******* Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we'll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering. **Speaker**: Julia Silge Julia is a data scientist and software engineer at [RStudio PBC](https://rstudio.com/) where she works on open source modeling tools. She is both an international keynote speaker and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice, and is the author of [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) with her coauthor David Robinson.

Its interface is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. There are simple functions for those everyday display table needs but also plenty of options for customizability should you need it. There is a defined table model that subdivides a table into its component parts. These include the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. All of these parts (and their component cells) can be targeted for the application of styling or the addition of footnotes. With all of the available options, there are many ways to customize the look of your table. The best way to get a feel for what gt can do is to take it for a spin, and so we’ll do that through some live demos. I’ll walk you though some code that progressively adds components to a gt table. Table cells will be formatted and, through styling, their appearance will be radically changed. The result in each case will be an HTML table that can be used in a variety of data products. **Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&A) Speaker: Avik Das, Software Engineer at LinkedIn Title: Dynamic programming for machine learning: Hidden Markov Models Abstract: A Hidden Markov Model deals with inferring the state of a system given some unreliable or ambiguous observations from that system. One important characteristic of this system is the state of the system evolves over time, producing a sequence of observations along the way. By incorporating some domain-specific knowledge, it’s possible to take the observations and work backwards to a maximally plausible ground truth. This talk explores Hidden Markov Models in three steps: First, I define Hidden Markov Models and how they apply to machine learning problems. Next, I build up an understanding of the Viterbi algorithm, used to infer the state of the system given a sequence of observations. This involves some basic math, but the goal is to form an intuition for the algorithm. Some sample Python code is presented to demonstrate how simple the algorithm is. Finally, I introduce several real-world applications of Hidden Markov Models in machine learning. In this section, real-world considerations like feature extraction and training are discussed. Basic math knowledge is expected, just the ability to express concepts as equations and an understanding of Big-O notation. Basic Python knowledge is helpful, but not required. The goal is build up intuition. **Code of Conduct**: https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct **LA R Users Group** Invite yourself to our Slack group: https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/ Ask us any questions by email: larusers@gmail.com Find our previous talks on GitHub: https://github.com/laRusers/presentations Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers Check out more events: https://laocr.org/	28	Science & Technology	PT1H8M55S	535	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SKWcNo_IWQk/maxresdefault.jpg		147	9	0	0	1

At the Fall 2019 Amercian Chemical Society National Meeting, two chemistry librarians partnered with a chemistry faculty member to offer a hands-on computer programming workshop. The workshop used the R programming environment, and was structured for beginners with no previous experience with R. Three main topics were covered during the five-hour session: introduction to R, working with QSAR data, and creating a report using R Markdown. This talk will cover the workshop’s logistics, instructional design, and content, and discuss feedback received from participants. Suggestions for future improvements will also be discussed. **Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&A) Speaker: Keren Xu Title: Draw fractals from root finding iteration in R Abstract: A talk on creating fractals by using root finding methods such as Newton Raphson and Secant method. Root-finding algorithms produce approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. We will write functions with some initial guesses of the root and find better approximations of the root through iterations until the approximation reaches a sufficient precision. The functions can be applied to a complex plane and the starting values that cause the method to converge with the corresponding numbers of iterations will be mapped to draw beautiful fractals. **Talk3** (25min talk, 5min Q&A) Speaker: Luke Morris Talk title: Bracketball: Let's Explore March Madness with ncaahoopR Abstract: Whether your interest in college basketball lasts for one month or all year around, the ncaahoopR package can catch you up on the teams or games you care about, and maybe even keep you alive in that office pool a while longer. **Code of Conduct**: https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct **Schedule** 6:15 open zoom 6:30-7:00 First talk 7:00-7:30 Second talk 7:30-8:00 Third Talk ~8:30 Virtual Social **LA R Users Group** Invite yourself to our Slack group: https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/ Ask us any questions by email: larusers@gmail.com Find our previous talks on GitHub: https://github.com/laRusers/presentations Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers Check out more events: https://laocr.org/ ***** DON'T BE SHY ******* Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

There is so much you can do with R. However, there may be times when your data does not fit into one of the base types and/or you want to add metadata to vectors. vctrs is a developer-focused package that provides a clear path for creating your own S3-vector class, while ensuring that the classes you build integrate into user expectations for how vectors work in R. This presentation will discuss the why and how of using vctrs through the example of debkeepr, a package for integrating historical non-decimal currencies such as pounds, shillings, and pence into R. The presentation will provide a step-by-step process for developing various types of vectors and thinking through the design process of how vectors of different classes should work together. ** About Talk1 Speaker ** I am a historian of early modern Europe and currently a lecturer at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. My research investigates the significance of sibling relationships and inheritance in the development of early modern capitalism. I have been using R for approximately two and a half years to analyze and visualize historical data. I am the author of two R packages that should be on CRAN shortly. The opencage package geocodes locations and is written in concert with Maëlle Salmon and Daniel Possenriede, among others. I am also writing a package called debkeepr that integrates non-decimal currencies into R through the basis provided by the vctrs package. **Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&A) Title: “Starter Guide to R Plumber + Slack” Presented by: Emad Hasan, Founder & COO at Retina In this talk, I will cover how you can use R Plumber to interact with Slack and surface analysis and data directly in Slack on demand.

Carlos Guestrin, Presents Practical, Large-Scale Machine Learning Data Science is perhaps the hottest profession on the market today. Folks with backgrounds ranging from Statistics and Physics to Engineering and Computer Science are eager and excited to transition to this field. However, designing and deploying data analysis and machine learning apps at scale is a significant challenge to overcome: For some folks, machine learning algorithms and methods can be obscure, too mathy, and disconnected from practice. For others, writing and deploying scalable software requires significant effort, which distracts them from focusing on their deep analytic efforts. In this talk Carlos covered a key set of techniques for data engineering, modeling, and deployment, which can help getting started in large-scale machine learning problems.

Revisiting, I will ask how much has changed - or not. Namespaces have brought even more justification for emphasizing functions as the main ingredients of much of good R code. We have more and better tools for reproducible research and data analysis nowadays, and I'll touch on some consequences I see for useR's code organization. As some of it has been my specialty within R Core, we'll also look into some aspects of a generalized FAQ 7.31 and what every programmeR should know about computer arithmetic. --------------------------------------	28	Science & Technology	PT1H1M20S	80	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytbX-T1A8wE/maxresdefault.jpg		3892	16	0	0	1
