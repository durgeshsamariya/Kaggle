Our goal is to count how many customers used coupons in one of eight coupon groups (all combinations of the three store coupons from the Coupon Redemption Table) and then extract the customer names in each group. Learn about many Power Query features and functions. This trick comes from Bill Szysz, Power Query Master, at YouTube. The data and goals are: 1) Each customer was given coupons to go to Wegmans, Publix, Trader Joe's. 2) We have a list of Stores names. 3) We have a list of transactions for the coupon redemptions that lists purchases, customer name and store 4) Goal 1: Count Customers who visited a given set of stores. 5) Goal 2: List Customers who visited a given set of stores. Topics: 1. (00:13) Introduction & Problem Introduction 2. (02:35) Import From Excel Table 3. (04:01) Left Outer Merge or Left Outer Join 4. (06:47) Reference another Query in Power Query 5.

(05:37) See how to show Implicit Measures in the Measure Grid. 4. (07:17) Create Explicit Measures and see these five reasons why we should use Measures: 1) You choose what functions go into your Measure, 2) You can name the Measure, 3) You can apply Number Formatting that will follow the Measure around when it is reused., 4) You can use the formula over and over., 5) You won't have a bunch of extra Measures created by right-click, "Summarize Values By". 5.

Download Excel Files: https://people.highline.edu/mgirvin/YouTubeExcelIsFun/EMT1313..xlsm Download File: http://people.highline.edu/mgirvin/excelisfun.htm Formula posted by Bill Szysz. Lean how to create an Array Formula to Create Sorted Unique List in Cell. This is a huge complicated formula that requires the Excel 2016 function TEXTJOIN. There are many interesting formula elements in a single array formula to do the near impossible. Here are the topics covered (different parts that go into the final single cell formula): 1. (00:09) Problem Introduction 2. (01:43) Array of All Relative Positions & FALSEs for Unique List: using MATCH, IF and ROW functions. This is Formula Element #1. 3. (04:36) Unique Count: using previous formula element inside COUNT function. This is Formula Element #3. 4. (05:03) Array of Sequential Numbers for Unique Count: using ROW function, INDIRECT function and previous formula element. In chapter 7 of the Ctrl + Shift + Enter book, this formula element is called “Dynamic Variable-Length Array of Sequential Numbers”. Learn about the difference between using “1:” (just a row reference) and “A1:A” (a range of cells reference) (trick from Bill Szysz) in this formula element. This is Formula Element #3. 5. (06:58) Array of All Relative Positions: using SMALL function, Formula Element #1 and Formula Element #2. This is Formula Element #4. 6. (08:13) Unique List: using INDEX function, N function, IF function and Formula Element #5. 7. (09:57) Ranks (How Many Equal To or Above): using Formula Element #5, TRANSPOSE Function, Comparative Operator (to help sort), MMULT function (to add rows and convert 9 by 9 array into a single column array with the dimensions 9 by 1), Formula Element #3, and an exponent of zero (to convert all numbers to one). This is a trick I first learned from Domenic at the Mr Excel Message Board. This is Formula Element #6. 8. (16:08) Sort Relative Positions of Rank: using: MATCH function, Formula Element #3 and Formula Element #6. This is Formula Element #7. 9. (18:07) Sorted Unique List: using INDEX function, Formula Element #5 (Unique List), Formula Element #7 (Sort Relative Positions of Rank), N function, IF function and TEXTJOIN function. This is the final formula. 10. (20:30) Summary, Closing Note.	27	Education	PT20M54S	1254	2d	hd	false		1	7465	136	3	0	73

Research Hypothesis: I am going to investigate how the shape of the boomerang affects the flight of the boomerang. For my shape experiment I will make three winged boomerangs and I think the boomerang will fly higher If there is more “wing sweep” to the left for a right handed boomerang (where wing sweep is defined as bend in the wing). Conclusion: For my shape experiment I made three winged boomerangs and I discovered: 1. When I made a boomerang with More “Wing Sweep” To The Left the boomerang flew higher than the other two boomerangs. 2. When I made a boomerang with No “Wing Sweep “the boomerang flew medium height. 3. When I made a boomerang with More “Wing Sweep” To The Right the boomerang flew lower than the other two boomerangs. In conclusion, the shape does affect the way the boomerang flies.	27	Education	PT1M23S	83	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a9ra18PFhGI/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2721	39	3	0	6

(00:09) Intro to topic and look back to #181 Excel Magic Trick made 7 years ago! 2. (00:41) Look at problems with trying to create a formula that can count with Case Sensitive Criteria, including COUNTIF and FIND functions. 3. (01:31) EXACT function to check whether two text strings are the same including Case. 4. (01:47) COUNTIF and similar functions cannot handle array operations. 5. (01:59) Start formula with a function argument array operation in the EXACT function. 6. (02:54) Wrap COUNTIF around EXACT function and array operation and test to see if this is allowed. It is NOT allowed. The range argument in the COUNTIF function cannot handle array operations. See the useless Error Dialog box that COUNTIF delivers… 7. (03:34) Wrap SUMPRODUCT around EXACT function and array operation and see that SUMPRODUCT can handle the array operation, but that it cannot “see” the TRUE FALSE values. 8. (04:09) Use Double Negative to convert the TRUE and FALSE values to ones (1) and zeroes (0) so that SUMPRODUCT can understand and count the values that match the Case Sensitive Criteria. Use Double Negative because, of all the math operations that can convert TRUE and FALSE values to ones (1) and zeroes (0), it is the most efficient. 9. (05:10) Prove that Double Negative converts the TRUE and FALSE values to ones (1) and zeroes (0) by using the F9 key and then the Esc key (because we want to revert back to the cell contents before we used F2 key to put formula in edit mode.

How does Data Table with Empty Cell work? Here: Data Table is a feature that copies many formulas down by substituting in a new input from the column based on a cell that is a formula input into the formula. Because the cell is an "Empty Cell" that is NOT a formula input in the formula being copied, Data Table tries to make a substitution, but it can't, and therefore it just copies formula down. Because it is a randomizing formula, every time it gets copied down a row, it randomizes. If you need to be reminded about how the Data Table feature works, see my earlier videos in this class here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJPPUvJ7c8&index=5&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0mSJCZaqQPFj0eto4qnzkCZ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3komnmHvglc&index=6&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0mSJCZaqQPFj0eto4qnzkCZ Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.	27	Education	PT23M45S	1425	2d	hd	true		1	36650	375	5	0	61

For our example we convert Proper Data Sets in Excel to a Table and use “Add to Data Model” button in PowerPivot Ribbon Tab 3) (01:00) Excel 2016: New PowerPivot Ribbon Tab. They have renamed “Calculated Field” Button (Excel 2013) to “Measure” button (Excel 2016). We can build DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) with this new button. 4) (02:24) Step 2 for Building Data Model: Create Relationships between related tables using the “Diagram View” button in the “Manage Data Model” window. 5) (02:47) Excel 2016: New one-to-many visual presentation in the Diagram View window. We can see a line with the number one ( 1 ) next to the primary key field in the lookup table (dimension table) and an asterisk next to the Foreign Key in the Fact table. 6) (03:34) Step 3 for Building Data Model: Build DAX Calculated Column formulas. In this example we calculate Net Revenue for each transaction using the RELATED DAX function and the ROUND DAX function and a number of columns from the Fact Table. We also learn about the convention for adding columns to DAX formulas: ALWAYS use the Table Name and the Field Name (Column Name) with square brackets around it. 7) (05:56) Discussion of Implicit vs. Explicit formulas. 8) (05:56) Step 3 for Building Data Model: Build DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) formulas. In this example we will calculate Total Net Revenue using the DAX SUM function and the Calculated Column from our Fact Table. This is an explicit formula that can work efficiently with the Columnar database on big data sets. 9) (07:17) Add Number Formatting to Measure (Calculated Field) 10) (07:32) Discussion of Filter Context: The ability of the Measure (Calculate Field) to respect criteria in the PivotTable and filter the underlying table to result in a range that is smaller than the full table size and will contribute to faster formula calculation time; in essence the DAX formula and the Columnar Database work together efficiently – and much more efficiently than normal PivotTable calculations or normal spreadsheet Excel formulas. 11) (08:00) Build PivotTable from Data Model 12) (08:30) Excel 2016: New “F of X” Function Icon for Measures (Calculated Fields) in the PivotTable Field List. 13) (09:23) More discussion of Filter Context and why DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) can calculate efficiently on Big Data. 14) (09:59) Summary and Conclusion Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.

For people who have used VLOOKUP and Helper Columns to prepare data tables for PivotTables and who want to learn what building Data Models in PowerPivot is all about: This is the perfect videos for you. We will have a PowerPoint Introduction to what PowerPivot and Data Models are, then we will remind ourselves how we build Data Models in Excel all the while comparing what we are used to doing in Excel and how it will change when we get to PowerPivot, then we will build a simple Data Model in PowerPivot to get an introduction before we move on to our next video where we will learn how to build a Big Data Data Model in PowerPivot. From Excel Data Models to Big Data PowerPivot Data Models Topics in Video: 1) (00:16) Introduction to building Data Models with PowerPivot 2) (00:55) Topics in this video 3) (02:05) What is PowerPivot? 4) (03:21) What versions of Excel have PowerPivot? Notes for Excel 2013 and Excel 2016 5) (03:54) What is the Data Model? 6) (04:37) What DAX stands for (Data Analysis Expressions) 7) (06:05) What is Data Modeling? 8) (07:38) What are Related Tables? 9) (08:55) References for more advanced PowerPivot and Data Modeling 10) (09:23) Where to find notes in the downloadable PowerPoint about DAX formulas and Calculated Columns and Measures (Calculated Fields) 11) (09:40) IMPORTANT if you are NEW to PowerPivot: Remind ourselves how we build Data Models in Excel all the while comparing what we are used to doing in Excel and how it will change when we get to PowerPivot 12) (15:46) Step 1 in Building Data Model: Import Proper data sets into PowerPivot Data Model: 1) Convert tables to Excel Tables (Ctrl + T and Alt, J, T, A), 2) Click Add to Data Model button in PowerPivot Ribbon Tab. 13) (17:41) Intro to Manage Data Model window 14) (20:17) Step 2 in Building Data Model: Build Relationships using Diagram View. Simply drag and drop fields from dimension table to fact table. 15) (22:07) Step 3 in Building Data Model: Build DAX Calculated Columns 16) (22:58) DAX function: RELATED (substitute for VLOOKUP) 17) (23:23) Introduction to Table Names and Field Names (Field name in square brackets) in DAX formulas 18) (23:45) How formulas are copied in a Calculated Column 19) (24:21) Convention for building DAX formulas: 1) When you use a column name (field name) in a formula use both Table Name AND Field Name, when you use a Measure (Calculated Field) use only the Measure Name in Square Brackets. 20) (26:10) DAX function: ROUND 21) (26:30) Row Context for DAX Calculated Columns 22) (27:26) Example of Implicit Formula in a PowerPivot Data Model PivotTable. Why we should not use Implicit Formulas. 23) (30:02) Step 3 in Building Data Model: Build DAX Calculated Columns and Measures (Calculated Fields). This will not be an Implicit Formula. It will be an Explicit Formula. 24) (31:11) The Implicit “Sum of Net revenue” Formula shows up in Formula Field Dropdown List: DO NOT use it! 25) (31:51) Add Number Formatting to our Measures (Calculated Fields). 26) (32:05) Create PivotTable Report using our new DAX Measures (Calculated Fields). 27) (32:38) Filter Context for DAX Measures (Calculated Fields). 28) (32:58) Why we should not use Implicit Formulas AND Why we should use Explicit Formulas AND why DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) Calculate quickly on Big Data: Filter Context cause DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) to filter the underlying table so it has to process on a smaller table than the full-unfiltered table. 29) (34:59) Summary and Conclusion Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.	27	Education	PT36M23S	2183	2d	hd	true		1	102855	1030	22	0	82

(00:15 min) Goal of video: Master Name Sheet will contains names of students. Assignment sheets will contain scores for each assignment or section of the class. Summary Table will pull students data from each sheet. 2. (01:50 min) Drill Through many Sheets to add a formula on each assignment sheet that will pick up new students added to the Master Name Sheet. Use the IF function and a Null Text String to check for cells with no student name. 3. (04:17 min) Create Dynamic Range Formula using INDEX and MATCH and "looking up last Text Entry in Column" or "Big Text" formula trick, and then paste name into Name Manager to create a Defined Name Dynamic Range Formula. 4. (09:10 min) Use Defined Name Dynamic Range Formula for a Data Validation Drop Down List in a cell on the Summary Table. 5. (09:47 min) Create MATCH formula to lookup last row for student assignment data. 6. (12:16 min) Create INDIRECT Formula that will create a different sheet reference for each row in the summary table. In essence, the INDIRECT function that uses the Ampersand and Mixed Cell References and Absolute Cell References will create a different lookup table for the VLOOKUP function for each row in the summary table based on the sheet name that comes from each row header at the head of each row in the summary table. 7. (15:06 min) VLOOKUP to lookup the scores from each assignment sheet for the selected student. 8.

Array formulas are advanced formulas that act on arrays (ranges) instead of individual cell references. 3) 9 Formula Elements (sorts of things that we put into formulas): 1. Equal sign (starts all formulas) 2. Cell references (also defined names, sheet references, workbook references) 3. Math operators (plus, subtract, multiply, and so on) 4. Numbers (if the number will not change; for example, 12 months, 24 hours) 5. Built-in functions (AVERAGE, SUM, COUNTIF, DOLLAR, PMT, and so forth) 6. Comparative operators (equal, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, Not) 7. The ampersand join symbol (&) (Shift + 7) 8.

From given name list all groups that have selected that name horizontally. 2. Which means extract items with one condition. 3. Display items horizontally: use COLUMNS function for number incrementor. 4. "Data extraction" array formula 5. Problem: one lookup value, "Name", that shows up as multiple duplicates in a column. 6. Therefore you have many "matched" row numbers that the lookup function has to deal with. 7. Because we have an array of "matched" row numbers means we must use an array formula. 8. Lookup function will be: INDEX. 9. Function that can "select" correct "relative position" for INDEX function as we copy formula down: SMALL or AGGREGATE. 10. IF function or Boolean array operation will help us with our one condition "Name". 11. AGGREGATE is only in Excel 2010 or later. AGGREGATE can do array calcualtion in array argumnet for functions 14 to 19 without having to enter the formula with Ctrl + Shift + Enter. 12. IF with logical test is better to use than IFERROR because the IF will not run the entire array formula lookup function for cells that should return a null text string. IFERROR will run the entire array formula in every cell. This matters for formula calculation time. Key Concepts: 1. One lookup value 2. Multiple "matches" in a column. 3. Multiple "matches" causes problems for standard lookup functions. 4. Multiple "matches" means multiple "Realative Positions" 5. We must then create an array of these "Realative Positions" in our formula. 6. This requirement that we create an array of relative positions makes this an array formula. 7.

Shift + Tab: puts the item in the cell and moves the selected cell to left. 4. Shift + Enter: puts the item in the cell and moves the selected cell up. 5. When one cell is selected, Ctrl + Enter: puts the item in the cell and keeps the cell with the item selected. 6. When more than one cell is selected, Ctrl + Enter: puts the item simultaneously into all the selected cells at once. 7. Ctrl + Shift + Enter is the special keystroke for certain "Array Formulas" that is used to enter the array formula into the cell. For certain array formulas, if you don't use this keystroke you will get a #VALUE! error or an implicit intersection answer (potential incorrect answer). When you use this keystroke, curly brackets are put around the formula. These curly brackets cannot be typed in. For certain array formulas the "Ctrl + Shift + Enter" is your way of telling Excel to make an array calculation. The curly brackets are Excel's way of telling you that it understood that this was an array formula.	27	Education	PT7M44S	464	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fp2rdPhwI6I/maxresdefault.jpg	1	4107	52	1	0	6

Calculate the Sample Covariance using Excel function COVARIANCE.S 4. Measure Strength and Direction of Relationship with Coefficient of Correlation 5. Calculate Coefficient of Correlation long hand to get a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship. This number will vary from -1 to 0 to +1 (minus one to zero to positive one) and will indicate a perfect indirect (negative) relationship when minus one, no relationship when it is zero and a perfect direct relationship when it is positive one. 6. Reasonable positive number = Direct, Positive Relationship: As x increases, y increases 7. Reasonable negative number = Indirect, Negative Relationship: As x increases, y decreases 8.

Formula for slope is derived from the expression minSUM(y observed value -- y Predicted value)^2 using differential calculus. See text page 667. 2. Calculate Slope and Y-Intercept for Regression Line long hand. 3. Calculate Slope using the SLOPE Function 4. Calculate the y-Intercept using the INTERCEPT Function 5. Slope = Rise Over Run = For every one unit of x, how far does y move? 6. Y-intercept = y value where x = zero. = point at which line crosses axis 7. Use slope and y-intercept to create estimated simple linear regression equation (line or model) 8. From sample data, the slope and y-intercept are point estimates for the population parameters for slope and y-intercept 9. Use estimated simple linear regression line to make predictions 10. Be careful when making predictions with the estimated simple linear regression equation (line or model) when the x values are outside the range of the sample data. Why? Because the data may show a linear relationship over the range of sample data, but may show some other relationship outside that sampled range. 11.

Calculate Total Sum Of Squares (Total Y Deviations Squared) = SST = How well observations cluster around Y Bar (Y Mean Plotted Line) = Total squared deviations of y observed and Mean of Y (Ybar) 2. Calculate Sum of Squares Due To Error = SSE = How well observations cluster around estimated simple linear regression equation = sum of squares of deviations between y observed and y predicted = measure of variation that is not explained by the estimated simple linear regression equation (line or model). 3. Calculate Sum of Squares Due To Regression = SSR = SST -- SSE = sum of squares of deviations between y predicted and Mean of Y (Ybar) 4. Relationship between SST and SSR and SST is: SST = SSR + SSE. When there is no error, the predicted values and the observed values would all lie on the regression line and therefore SSE would equal zero. In this case SST = SSR + 0 and SSR/SST = 1, which means perfect "goodness of fit". This means that the Coefficient of Determination will always be a number between 0 and 1. 0 = "no goodness of fit" and 1 = "perfect goodness of fit". 5. SSR/SST = Coefficient of Determination = R Squared = r^2 6. Use RSQ function to calculate Coefficient of Determination 7. Use Coefficient of Correlation Squared to calculate coefficient of Determination 8. Coefficient of Determination can be used for linear and non-linear relationships. This is compared to Coefficient of Correlation, which can only be used for linear relationships.

This means you must use other means like the SUMPRODUCT function. Mr Excel Message Board post from barry houdini: Point #1: SUMIF, and the like, only accept ranges of cells, not arrays Point #2: Functions such as YEAR, TEXT that are expecting a single value and are given a range (except for LOOKUP and SUMPRODUCT) become arrays if the argument is given a range Point#3: A range extracted from a closed workbook becomes an array and thus for a SUMIF function yields a #VALUE error. To fix this use the INDIRECT function, or just use SUMPRODUCT. SUM with Multiple Criteria SUM with more than 1 Criteria SUMIF to another workbook #VALUE! Error because range gets converted to an array.	28	Science & Technology	PT10M22S	622	2d	sd	false		1	13212	53	2	0	5

Point #2: You tell Excel that you have an array formula by the key strokes Ctrl + Shift + Enter. If you do not use these keys, Excel will not know it is an array formula Point #3: SUMPRODUCT and LOOKUP are examples of functions that can handle arrays without Ctrl + Shift + Enter, so they are not array formulas.

Create a Frequency Distribution and then a Histogram. Basic Statistics. Mean Median Mode, and Standard Deviation Mean Median and Mode are all Averages The reason we have averages is because we need "ONE" value that will represent all the values so we can talk about the "typical score". All the data is so spread out that is hard to talk about 'all" the data unless we calculate a typical value. Here are three ways to calculate a typical value: Mean, Median Mode. MEAN is the arithmetic mean (add all the scores and divide by the count). In Excel we use the AVERAGE function MEDIAN is the one in the middle (position) after we have sorted (this is good when we have extreme values like in real estate (most of the houses are around $200,000, but a few are $1,000,000)). In Excel we use the MEDIAN function MODE is the one that occurs most often. This is good when we have "word" categories such as preference for "cola". In Excel we use the MODE function (It will not tell you when there are more than 1 mode). The Standard Deviation tells you: 1) how spread out the data is; 2) what the mean deviation is; 3) does the average represent its data points fairly. In Excel we use the STDEV function for a sample and the STDEVP function for a population (population is all possible values; sample is some of the values but not all). Histogram. SUMPRODUCT COUNTIF function formula. Column Chart Ampersand Concatenate all these functions ignore blanks or dashes. If you really want to include them you must put a zero instead of a dash or blank.	28	Science & Technology	PT11M14S	674	2d	sd	false		1	148689	305	29	0	69

Save time when creating spreadsheets by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter. 1) If one cell is highlighted and you type a word or formula, when you hit Ctrl + Enter, the word or formula gets put in the cell and the cell remains highlighted. This is efficient when you want to put the word or formula in the cell and then immediately do something to the cell like copy it or format it. 2) If more than one cell is highlighted and you type a word or formula in the active cell, when you hit Ctrl + Enter, all the cells are populated with the word or formula. This is true even if you have non-contiguous cells highlighted. Active Cell is the cell in the highlighted range that is a light color Non-contiguous cells means cells that are not right next to each other; example A1:A3, C2:D4. If you want to edit a bunch of formulas that are all the same, highlighting the whole range, hitting F2 to put the active cell formula into edit mode, editing the formula, and then hitting Ctrl + Enter is efficient	28	Science & Technology	PT6M26S	386	2d	sd	false		1	21117	102	3	0	15
