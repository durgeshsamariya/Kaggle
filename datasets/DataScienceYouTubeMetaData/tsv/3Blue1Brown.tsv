At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation. At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!. At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.

This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao. https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle. Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite. This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity. ------------------ These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library: https://github.com/3b1b/manim If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

The source code for this video is visible at the link below, but the, er, awkward part is that it was made on a branch of manim where I'm reworking a lot of other things and have yet to work out all the kinks or add any documentation, so I'm not entirely sure how easy it will be for others to get running. In either case, you should be able to easily see how all the simulations worked. https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/shaders/from_3b1b/old/sir.py Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions. For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with. --------------- Opening music: Candlepower by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) Source: http://chriszabriskie.com/divider/ Artist: http://chriszabriskie.com/ Other music by Vincent Rubinetti.

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/covid-thanks Excellent visualization of this kind of growth from Minutephysics and Aatish Bhatia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other. Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91. While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves. If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I Extrapolation xkcd: https://xkcd.com/605/ ------------------ These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library: https://github.com/3b1b/manim If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/spiral-thanks Based on this Math Stack Exchange post: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/885879/meaning-of-rays-in-polar-plot-of-prime-numbers/885894 Want to learn more about rational approximations? See this Mathologer video. https://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg Also, if you haven't heard of Ulam Spirals, you may enjoy this Numberphile video: https://youtu.be/iFuR97YcSLM Dirichlet's paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1408.pdf Important error correction: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate. (By "allowable", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video). What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence. Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper. If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there. In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through. It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it. But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann! My apologies for the mistake. If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know. ------------------ These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library: https://github.com/3b1b/manim If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

I loved it! Y'all are the best. Here are just two of my favorites. By a channel STEM cell: https://youtu.be/ils7GZqp_iE By Doga Kurkcuoglu: http://bilimneguzellan.net/bouncing-cubes-and-%CF%80-3blue1brown/ And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html NY Times blog post about this problem: https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/ The original paper by Gregory Galperin: https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper. In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's. This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove. Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way. In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor. The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”. Whoops! I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up. Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters. And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do. Really, the velocity scales of eddies decreases for lower length scales.

Special thanks to these supporters: http://3b1b.co/winding-thanks Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this. For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.

What about all the lighthouses on the far end? Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible. In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible. For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/uncertainty-thanks And by Art of Problem Solving: http://aops.com/3b1b For more on quantum mechanical wave functions, I highly recommend this video by udiprod: https://youtu.be/p7bzE1E5PMY Minute physics on special relativity: https://youtu.be/1rLWVZVWfdY Main video on the Fourier transform https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY Louis de Broglie thesis: http://aflb.ensmp.fr/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf More on Doppler radar: Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808 There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality. Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time. In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF). This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp. Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF. As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration. However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF. See the above article for more information.

For any early-stage ML startup founders, Amplify Partners would love to hear from you via 3blue1brown@amplifypartners.com To learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ The book walks through the code behind the example in these videos, which you can find here: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning MNIST database: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ Also check out Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/ His post on Neural networks and topology is particular beautiful, but honestly all of the stuff there is great. And if you like that, you'll *love* the publications at distill: https://distill.pub/ For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: https://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs "But I've already voraciously consumed Nielsen's, Olah's and Welch's works", I hear you say.

Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that! For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy There are two neat things about this book. First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it. And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.

This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves. I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at http://3b1b.co/essence-of-linear-algebra Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18. Thanks for the catch! *Note on conventions: Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction. The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin. What's the difference? Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right. They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters). Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state. Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.

Supplement to the cryptocurrency video: How hard is it to find a 256-bit hash just by guessing and checking? What kind of computer would that take? Cryptocurrency video: https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4 Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/ Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average. This depends on the thing being attempted. If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function. Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/ Brought to you by you: https://3b1b.co/fractals-thanks And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/careers Music by Vince Rubinetti: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension. The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2. Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more). A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!). The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose "Hausdorff dimension" is greater than its "topological dimension". Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe. Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc. For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262. A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension 2.3. And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer. See Mandelbrot's book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" for the full details and more examples. ------------------ 3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation. *Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead. It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

There's an improved version: https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ Also, for the calculus-savvy, you'll prefer this one: https://youtu.be/v0YEaeIClKY Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/ The enigmatic equation e^{pi i} = -1 is usually explained using Taylor's formula during a calculus class. This video offers a different perspective, which involves thinking about numbers as actions, and about e^x as something which turns one action into another.
