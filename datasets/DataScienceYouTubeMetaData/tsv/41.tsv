Now you can know whether someone has read your email or not. Microsoft outlook allows you to get Read Receipts of your sent emails. A delivery receipt confirms delivery of your microsoft outlook email message to the recipient's mailbox, but not that the recipient has seen it or read it. A read receipt confirms that your message was opened in microsoft outlook In Outlook, the message recipient can decline to send read receipts. There are other scenarios where read receipts are not sent, such as if the recipient's email program doesn’t support read receipts. There is no way to force a recipient to send a read receipt in microsoft outlook Request read and/or delivery receipts for all messages that you send On the File menu, select Options - Mail. Under Tracking, select the Delivery receipt confirming the message was delivered to the recipient's e-mail server or Read receipt confirming the recipient viewed the message check box. Add tracking information to your messages. Tip: As a best practice, consider tracking only single messages of importance instead of all messages. Recipients who occasionally receive a notification that a read receipt is requested on your message are more likely to send a read receipt than if they are prompted every time that they receive a message from you. Click OK to apply your changes. Track a single message in microsoft outlook In a new email message, on the Options menu, in the Tracking group, select the Request a Delivery Receipt check box or the Request a Read Receipt check box. Request a read receipt command on the ribbon Compose your email and click Send. Track receipt responses Open the original message that you sent with a request for a delivery or read receipt. This message is usually located in the Sent Items folder. On the Message tab, in the Show group, choose Tracking. Note: Tracking doesn’t appear until at least one receipt has been received. After you receive the first receipt in your Inbox, it might take several minutes before the Tracking button is available.

Now With Windows 10 you can activate the ultimate performance mode to get more power when using power intensive application in your Windows PC or Windows laptop Here is the code to be used in the Windows PowerShell (Admin) -------------------------------------------------------- powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61 ---------------------------------------------------------- Before activating your windows Ultimate Performance power plan, please ensure that your windows is activated . To activate your Windows you can see this video ---------------------------------------- Activate Windows 10 - 8 - 7 Without Any Software in Hindi - https://youtu.be/szNMXugTHtA --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To get the ultimate performance mode on your pc or laptop you need to activate it as shown in this tech tutorial and then go to the power options and select it. What the Ultimate Performance power plan does is boost the performance of high-power systems. It is designed to reduce or eliminate micro-latencies related to fine-grained power management techniques. If you notice a slight delay between the time your OS recognizes that a piece of hardware needs more power and the time it is actually delivered, you are experiencing a micro-latency. No matter how short the delay is, it can still make a difference. The Ultimate Performance plan is designed to get rid of hardware polling, allowing the equipment or peripheral to consume all the power it needs. Moreover, it disables any power-saving features to enhance performance. That said, if a device operates on battery power, it does not have this option by default. After all, the feature consumes more power, killing the battery much faster.	27	Education	PT4M2S	242	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDao5gmmne0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1870	47	0	0	8

The easiest way to convert time to decimal in Excel is to multiply the original time value by the number of hours, seconds or minutes in a day: To convert time to a number of hours, multiply the time by 24, which is the number of hours in a day. To convert time to minutes, multiply the time by 1440, which is the number of minutes in a day (24*60). To convert time to seconds, multiply the time time by 86400, which is the number of seconds in a day (24*60*60 ). How to convert time to hours in Excel To convert time in excel the Another way is to use the following Convert formula: =CONVERT(A2, "day", "hr") Formula 3: HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND functions Finally, you can use a bit more complex formula, whose logic, however, is quite obvious. Extract the individual time units by using the HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND functions, then divide minutes by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) and seconds by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour), and add up the results: =HOUR(A2) + MINUTE(A2)/60 + SECOND(A2)/3600 How to convert time to minutes in Excel To covert "time - minutes" with the CONVERT(number, from_unit, to_unit) function, supply "day" as the unit to convert from and "mn" as the unit to convert to: =CONVERT(A2, "day", "mn") Formula 3: HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND functions One more way to get the number of minutes is to multiply hours by 60 and divide seconds by the same number: =HOUR(A2)*60 + MINUTE(A2) + SECOND(A2)/60 How to convert time to seconds in Excel Down Load Practice Files from http://www.myelesson.org/downloads ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy Top Rated Products on Amazon That You Might Like https://www.amazon.in/shop/mye-lesson	27	Education	PT3M57S	237	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UrybpSlERAM/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2388	104	3	0	5

Many times you want to PROTECT EXCEL SHEET so that only SPECIFIC CELLS CAN BE EDITED . Now you can PASSWORD PROTECT EXCEL SHEET in such way that ONLY FEW CELLS CAN BE EDITED and the rest of the sheet can not be edited.

You can lock all the cells in a worksheet or specific cells, allowing some parts of the spreadsheet to be changed. Here's how. How to Lock All the Cells in a Worksheet By default, when you protect a sheet or workbook, all of the cells will be locked. This means they can't be reformatted or deleted, and the content in them can't be edited. By default, the locked cells can be selected, but you can change that in the protection options. 1.

How to Lock Specific Cells in a Worksheet There might be times when you want to lock certain cells from being changed but still allow users to adjust other cells in a worksheet. In our example, in an inventory list you might allow unit prices and stock quantities to be updated, but not the item IDs, names, or descriptions. As mentioned above, all cells are locked by default when you protect the sheet. However, you can specify whether a cell should be locked or unlocked in the cell's format properties. 1. Select all the cells you don't want to be locked. These will be the cells that can be edited even after the sheet is protected. 2. Right-click on your selection, select Format Cells, and click on the Protection tab.

Best use of Excel charts is when you know which excel chart to use when. Each chart has a specific purpose and if used for that then the you will get best excel chart usage. The most used excel charts that i have covered in this video are listed below Line Charts - how when to use a Line chart. Data that's arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a line chart. In a line chart, category data is distributed evenly along the horizontal axis, and all value data is distributed evenly along the vertical axis. Line charts can show continuous data over time on an evenly scaled axis, so they're ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, like months, quarters, or fiscal years. Pie chart - how when to use a Pie chart. Data that's arranged in one column or row on a worksheet can be plotted in a pie chart. Pie charts show the size of items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole pie. Bar Chart -how when to use a bar chart. Data that's arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a bar chart. Bar charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In a bar chart, the categories are typically organized along the vertical axis, and the values along the horizontal axis. Treemap chart -how when to use a Treemap chart The treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and an easy way to compare different levels of categorization. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity and can easily show lots of data which would be difficult with other chart types. The treemap chart can be plotted when empty (blank) cells exist within the hierarchal structure and treemap charts are good for comparing proportions within the hierarchy. Combo Chart - how when to use a Combo Chart Data that's arranged in columns and rows can be plotted in a combo chart. Combo charts combine two or more chart types to make the data easy to understand, especially when the data is widely varied. Shown with a secondary axis, this chart is even easier to read. In this example, we used a column chart to show the number of homes sold between January and June and then used a line chart to make it easier for readers to quickly identify the average sales price by month. Pareto Chart - how when to use a Pareto Chart A Pareto chart, named after Vilfredo Pareto, is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. Treemap Chart - how when to use a Treemap Chart A treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and makes it easy to spot patterns, such as which items are a store's best sellers. The tree branches are represented by rectangles and each sub-branch is shown as a smaller rectangle. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity and can easily show lots of data which would be difficult with other chart types. Treemap charts are good for comparing proportions within the hierarchy, however, treemap charts aren't great at showing hierarchical levels between the largest categories and each data point Sparkline Chart - how when to use a Sparkline Chart a sparkline is a tiny chart in a worksheet cell that provides a visual representation of data. Use sparklines to show trends in a series of values, such as seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles, or to highlight maximum and minimum values. Position a sparkline near its data for greatest impact. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT11M54S	714	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42d6I9BMONU/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2173	72	0	0	3

Excel Fuzzy logic vlookup formula works supports wildcards, but only in "exact match" mode. In this case, we are supplying the lookup value as val&"*", so if we type in a string like "ma" into the named range val , we are giving VLOOKUP "Ma*" as the lookup value. This will cause VLOOKUP to match the first entry in column B that begins with "ma". Wildcard matching is convenient, because you don't have to type in a full name, but note that you have to be careful of duplicates or near duplicates. For example, in the table there is a "Apple" and a "Mapple" so typing "Ple" will give you the first match, even though there are two. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT8M20S	500	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xPsTAAtP5Qk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	5243	201	2	0	28

Trace precedents in Excel 2019 will Display the relationships between formulas and cells Checking formulas for accuracy or finding the source of an error may be difficult if formula uses precedent or dependent cells: Precedent cells — cells that are referred to by a formula in another cell. For example, if cell D10 contains the formula =B5, then cell B5 is a precedent to cell D10. Dependent cells — these cells contain formulas that refer to other cells. For example, if cell D10 contains the formula =B5, cell D10 is a dependent of cell B5. To assist you in checking your formulas, you can use the Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents commands to graphically display and trace the relationships between these cells and formulas with tracer arrows, as shown in this figure. Worksheet with tracer arrows Follow these steps to display formula relationships among cells: Click File - Options - Advanced. Note: If you are using Excel 2007; click the Microsoft Office Button Office button image , click Excel Options, and then click the Advanced category. In the Display options for this workbook section, select the workbook and then check that All is chosen in For objects, show. To specify reference cells in another workbook, that workbook must be open. Microsoft Office Excel cannot go to a cell in a workbook that is not open. Trace cells that provide data to a formula (precedents) Follow these steps: Select the cell that contains the formula for which you want to find precedent cells. To display a tracer arrow to each cell that directly provides data to the active cell, on the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click Trace Precedents Button image . Blue arrows show cells with no errors. Red arrows show cells that cause errors. If the selected cell is referenced by a cell on another worksheet or workbook, a black arrow points from the selected cell to a worksheet icon Worksheet icon . The other workbook must be open before Excel can trace these dependencies. To identify the next level of cells that provide data to the active cell, click Trace Precedents Button image again. To remove tracer arrows one level at a time, begin with the precedent cell furthest away from the active cell. Then, on the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click the arrow next to Remove Arrows, and then click Remove Precedent Arrows Button image . To remove another level of tracer arrows, click the button again. Trace formulas that reference a particular cell (dependents) Follow these steps: Select the cell for which you want to identify the dependent cells.

Blue arrows show cells with no errors. Red arrows show cells that cause errors. If the selected cell is referenced by a cell on another worksheet or workbook, a black arrow points from the selected cell to a worksheet icon Worksheet icon . The other workbook must be open before Excel can trace these dependencies. To identify the next level of cells that depend on the active cell, click Trace Dependents Button image again. To remove tracer arrows one level at a time, starting with the dependent cell farthest away from the active cell, on the Formulas tab, in the Formula Auditing group, click the arrow next to Remove Arrows, and then click Remove Dependent Arrows Button image .

IFS formula can take the place of multiple nested IF formula, and is much easier to read with multiple conditions. How to use the IFS formula Generally, the syntax for the IFS formula is: =IFS([Something is True1, Value if True1,Something is True2,Value if True2,Something is True3,Value if True3) Please note that the IFS formula allows you to test up to 127 different conditions. However, we don't recommend nesting too many conditions with IF or IFS formula. This is because multiple conditions need to be entered in the correct order, and can be very difficult to build, test and update. Remarks of Excel IFS Formula 2019 To specify a default result, enter TRUE for your final logical_test argument. If none of the other conditions are met, the corresponding value will be returned. 1- If a logical_test argument is supplied without a corresponding value_if_true, this function shows a "You've entered too few arguments for this function" error message. 2- If a logical_test argument is evaluated and resolves to a value other than TRUE or FALSE, this function returns a #VALUE! error. 3- If no TRUE conditions are found, this function returns #N/A error. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT4M52S	292	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kXzDXb7oD3U/maxresdefault.jpg	1	13276	334	13	0	37

Creating Receipt Entries in Tally The link to the Shopify course on Template monster is https://school.templatemonster.com/en/shopify/ Let’s start with the first example of the receipt of interest in bank. I am talking about the interest which a bank pays on its savings account deposits to its customers. It is a simple receipt entry. I have already created ledgers for the receipt entries which I am going to explain in this post. You can see my post on creating ledgers in Tally to learn how you can create ledgers in Tally very easily. From Gateway of Tally, press V and then F6, and you will be directly in the Receipt Voucher in Tally. That was the shortcut route. I have created a PDF of 100+ shortcuts in Tally like the one above. If you want to take the long route, here is the long route. From Gateway of Tally, go to Accounting Vouchers. Then select Receipt from the Right Hand Side Green Bar as shown in the picture. Receipt Voucher in Tally Now you are in receipt voucher in Tally. Let’s start with the examples. Receipt of Bank Interest in Bank Account When you receive interest in your bank account, Interest account gets credited and Bank Account gets debited. Let’s say we got bank interest of Rs.1,000 in our bank account. The entry for this transaction in Tally will be as under: Creating-Bank-Interest-Receipt-entry-in-Tally Click on the image to see it clear. In the above transaction, Bank Interest got credited by Rs.1,000 and Bank Account got debited by Rs.1,000. If you receive anything in your Bank Account other than interest, just change the ledger and you will easily be able to create the receipt entry for the same. For example, you received a payment for selling goods, then instead of Bank Interest, Debtors Account will get credited. Now, let us look at the second entry i.e. which is receipt of cash from a debtor. Receipt of Cash From a Debtor I have selected this entry because it covers almost every receipt transaction you would have. The difference is instead of Debtor, you would have some other account. And I have already explained you receipt through Bank Account just above this entry. When you receive cash, Cash Account gets debited and Debtor’s Account gets credited. Let’s say we got Rs.5,000 in cash from a debtor named Amit. The entry for this transaction in Tally will be as under: Creating-Cash-Receipt-Voucher-from-Debtor-in-Tally Click on the image to see it clear. In the above transaction, Amit’s Account (Debtor) got credited and Cash Account gets debited. This is how the receipt entry is done in Tally. It is easy and simple. At the end… Receipts Entry in Tally or Receipt Voucher in Tally is one of the most simple entries in Tally that I have found till date. You will receive cash by two major ways in normal business transactions which are: Via Bank Direct Cash Example use din the video Cash A/C Dr. 500000 To Capital A/C 500000 (Cash brought as capital by Rahul) Cash account is Real A/c Capital A/c is Personal A/c Debit what comes in Credit what goes out Debit the reciever Credit the giver The link to the Shopify course on Template monster is https://school.templatemonster.com/en/shopify/ ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT3M13S	193	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tdv58CEZzBk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1229	34	1	0	5

It is very much easy to create a ledger in Tally.For a fact, it takes less than a 60 seconds to create a single ledger in Tally. There are total 2 major ways to create a ledger in Tally. One way is to create a Single Ledger and another way is to create it with Multiple Ledgers. When you need to create 1 or 2 ledgers, you can create it with the help of Single Ledger option. On the other hand, when you need to create more ledgers such as 100 ledgers or more ledgers, you can create it easily with help of an option called Multiple Ledgers. Let us look at both the methods – 1. Single Ledger Method and 2. Multiple Ledger Method one by one step by step. Single Ledger Method From Gateway of Tally, go to Accounts Info. Gateway-of-TallyThen go to Ledgers. creating-a-ledger-in-tally Now, under Single Ledger, select the option Create. create-a-single-ledger-in-tally Now you will see a simple Ledger Creation window in which you will have to enter certain details about the ledger. It looks like in the picture below. ledger-creation-window-in-tally Name – The first option is the Name of the ledger. Enter the name of the ledger, for example, Furniture A/c or Building A/c. Under – Every ledger requires a group to operate in. For example, Furniture A/c and Building A/c will be under Fixed Assets group as they are both Fixed Assets. You have to select a group that is required as per your ledger. Inventory values are affected – If you have a ledger which requires inventory or in simple words, stock to be maintained, set this option to Yes. For example, you are selling sim cards, your ledger will be Sim Cards. There must be a quantity to sell i.e. stock or inventory and so you must set Yes to Inventory Values are affected. Mailing Details – You have to fill in the mailing details like Name, Address, Country and Bank Details for the ledger. It is for the ledgers such as debtors and creditors which require these kind of details. Ledgers such as Furniture or Building do not require these details because they are not humans and therefore they do not have any mailing details. Tax Registration Details – Similar to mailing details, these details are also of people and not for ledgers like furniture, building etc. Tax registration details include PAN which is required on any tax related documents. Opening Balance – This is the opening balance of the ledger if any. Any balance of the ledger which is being carried forward from the previous year will have to be entered as the opening balance.

Merge excel Workbooks into one Combine multiple excel Workbooks into one excel sheet Combine data from multiple Workbooks into one master sheet Learn How to merge excel Workbooks in one file how to merge excel Workbooks in one How to Combine Multiple Excel Workbooks into Single Excel Workbook Combine Data From Multiple Workbook into a Single Workbook in Excel Merge Data from Multiple Excel Files in a single Excel Workbook Learn How to merge all excel Workbook data into one excel Workbook Then you have come to the right video. To summarize and report results from separate Workbooks, you can merge data from each Workbook into a master Workbook . The Workbook can be in the same folder as the master worksheet, or in other folder. When you merge data, you assemble data so that you can more easily update and aggregate as necessary. For example, if you have an expense Workbook for each of your regional offices, you might use consolidation to roll these figures into a master corporate expense Workbook . This master Workbook might also contain sales totals and averages, current inventory levels, and highest selling products for the entire enterprise. How to merge all Excel Workbook in one excel Workbook Follow these steps to merge several Workbook into a master Workbook : If you haven't already, set up the data in each constituent Workbook by doing the following: Ensure that each range of data is in list format. Each column must have a label (header) in the first row and contain similar data. There must be no blank rows or columns anywhere in the list. Put each range on a separate Workbook , but don't enter anything in the master Workbook where you plan to merge the data. Excel will do this for you. Ensure that each range has the same layout. In the master Workbook , click the upper-left cell of the area where you want the merged data to appear. Note: To avoid overwriting existing data in the master Workbook , ensure that you leave enough cells to the right and below this cell for the merged data. Click Data-merge (in the Data Tools group). Data Tools group on the Data tab In the Function box, click the summary function that you want Excel to use to merge the data. The default function is SUM. Here is an example in which three Workbook ranges have been chosen: Select your data. Next, in the Reference box, click the Collapse button to shrink the panel and select the data in the worksheet. Click the worksheet that contains the data you want to merge, select the data, and then click the Expand Dialog button on the right to return to the merge dialog. If a worksheet containing data that you need to merge is in another workbook, click Browse to locate that workbook. After locating and clicking OK, Excel will enter the file path in the Reference box and append an exclamation point to that path. You can then continue to select other data. In the merge popup window, click Add. Repeat this to add all of the ranges that you merge. Automatic vs. Manual updates: If you want Excel to update your consolidation table automatically when the source data changes, simply check the Create links to source data box. If this box remains unchecked, you can update the consolidation manually. You cannot create links when source and destination areas are on the same sheet. Click OK, and Excel will generate the consolidation for you. Optionally, you can apply formatting. It's only necessary to format once, unless you rerun the consolidation. Any labels that don't match up with labels in the other source areas result in separate rows or columns in the consolidation. Ensure that any categories that you don't want to merge have unique labels that appear in only one source range. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788	27	Education	PT4M29S	269	2d	hd	false		1	5359	218	10	0	12

Click the worksheet that contains the data you want to merge, select the data, and then click the Expand Dialog button on the right to return to the merge dialog. If a worksheet containing data that you need to merge is in another workbook, click Browse to locate that workbook. After locating and clicking OK, Excel will enter the file path in the Reference box and append an exclamation point to that path. You can then continue to select other data. In the merge popup window, click Add. Repeat this to add all of the ranges that you merge. Automatic vs. Manual updates: If you want Excel to update your consolidation table automatically when the source data changes, simply check the Create links to source data box. If this box remains unchecked, you can update the consolidation manually. You cannot create links when source and destination areas are on the same sheet. Click OK, and Excel will generate the consolidation for you. Optionally, you can apply formatting. It's only necessary to format once, unless you rerun the consolidation. Any labels that don't match up with labels in the other source areas result in separate rows or columns in the consolidation. Ensure that any categories that you don't want to merge have unique labels that appear in only one source range. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT4M52S	292	2d	hd	false		1	122883	1543	95	0	48

Download excel dashboard templates,from here http://www.myelesson.org/excel-training-videos/make-sales-dashboard-excel While Excel sales dashboards sometimes reveal periodic reporting data, the gold standard of sales dashboards are those that provide data in real time 1. MONTHLY SALES/NEW CUSTOMERS One of the easiest ways to evaluate your sales success is to compare monthly results over time. Monthly conversions KPI shows how many new customers bought your product or subscribed to your service during the current month. You can frame this KPI as merely the number of monthly sales or as “% of monthly sales quota” to evaluate whether you’re going to achieve your monthly sales goal. To understand what causes an increase or drop in one metric, you need to track further indicators to find correlations between multiple sales and marketing processes. 2. MONTHLY NEW LEADS/PROSPECTS This is a metric that depends wholly on the nature of your business. New leads can be people who sign up for a free trial. They may also be people who visit your website and spend a certain amount of time without yet ordering anything. Frame your monthly new leads metric so that it gives you accurate information about the number of new prospective customers. The monthly new leads KPI is beneficial in numerous ways. Compare it to your monthly conversions/new customers metric to calculate the average lead-to-sale conversion rate (see point 3). Measure the current month’s new leads to previous time periods to see whether your marketing spend’s justified. 3. LEAD-TO-SALE CONVERSION RATE Lead-to-sale conversion rate is the percentage of new customers compared to new leads. Conversion rate KPI shows whether your sales team is capable of turning prospective deals into a real business. Let’s say that 4% of your new leads convert into a paying customer. This means that 96 leads out of 100 bring in no business whatsoever. There are many ways to improve your lead-to-sale conversion rate. This can be done by providing better sales materials and offering a greater benefit to the prospect. You can also try discount offers or improved customer experience throughout the buying process. There’s always a reason why all new leads won’t become paying clients. Find out the cause and improve the sales results by tackling the problem. Want to increase your lead-to-sales conversion rate? Learn the tips, tricks, and hacks for successful lead management and acquire more customers. 4. COST PER LEAD Everything that your team does to attract new leads costs you money. Be it advertising costs, web design or social media management, it’s taking a considerable amount of your company’s budget Add the cost per lead KPI to your dashboard to see how much it costs to attract a prospective customer. Cost per lead is calculated by summing up all your monthly marketing-related costs and dividing it by the number of monthly new leads. Remember to include the salaries of your marketing team. Or at least,e the time they’ve spent on lead generation. To have accurate KPIs that reflect the actual situation, you need to gather a lot of data. A quick way to collect your data into one system is by using professional services automation software. The system enables you to use all the data for detailed reporting and real-time KPI dashboards and dashboard design, Decreasing cost per lead can be a sign of improved customer experience or increased brand awareness. The opposite result indicates that you need to oversee your marketing strategy and focus on more profitable channels through creating dashboards in excel, 5. COST PER CONVERSION Intuitively thinking, the cost per conversion seems similar to cost per lead in the sales dashboard,. In fact, the cost per conversion metric can be tens of times higher as per business intelligence sales,. Only a small number of your leads convert to paying customers or subscribers. This means that the cost per single conversion can be incredibly high. Cost per conversion is calculated as cost per lead, meaning that you sum up all your monthly marketing costs and divide it by the number of monthly new customers/sales.Dashboard in excel, To evaluate whether your cost per conversion pays off in the long-term, evaluate your customer lifetime value. business analytics, If the cost per conversion is so high that your customer lifetime value KPI is negative, you’re losing revenue and need to act quickly to improve your profitability score dash board or sales report dashboard templates ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA	27	Education	PT13M51S	831	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyM3Cpx-1do/maxresdefault.jpg	1	57991	616	17	0	21

Create a HR Excel dashboard with HR Metrics to measure the result of the HR activities. It can also be called a HR Business Intelligence dashboard as it will show the HR KPI in a graphical format. You can download this HR resource Dashboard example excel file from http://www.myelesson.org/excel-training-videos/make-hr-dashboard-excel What is a Human Resource Dashboard An HR Dashboard is a visual display of HR metrics. An HR Dashboard can be designed in different ways and used for different things, but its primary purpose is to publish important HR metrics relatively quickly, at a reasonably high level. The HR Dashboard is the visual representation of the metrics that an HR manager needs to keep a track of to judge the performance of different organizational departments. Common HR metrics are • Seniority • Sex: Common distinction often used for diversity purposes (see the example HR dashboard below) • Age: Age is becoming increasingly important with today’s aging workforce. Age is often a key focus point for organizations that want to innovate and reorganize. • Education level: Educational level should only be included when available and when relevant for the overarching goals of the organization. Otherwise, it runs the risk of being a ‘vanity metric’ in the HR report. • Function type: A metric like function type or function clusters might help to distinguish different groups within the company. An example could be top management, middle management, production personnel and support staff. • FTE: A Full-Time Equivalent is the hours worked by one employee on a full-time basis. The number of FTE is often lower than number of total employees. This holds especially true if there are a lot of part-time workers present in the organization. FTE provides an accurate measure of the total workload in the organization. In addition, people who work less than 1 FTE can be considered part-time workers. • Employees Active: This metrics represents the number of employees working at the organization. • Turnover: This metric represents the number and/or percentage of employees who left in the previous period. • New hires: This metric represents the number and/or percentage of new employees who joined the organization within the last year. • Absence: This metric represents the percentage of time that employees were absent in the previous period on average. Another representation of this number is the total days of absence per employee. • Cost of absence: This metric is not a standard metric but it can make the previously mentioned absence rate more tangible by attaching it to a financial number. • Cost of labor: Labor cost is the total amount of money that an organization pays to its workforce. This number includes employee benefits and payroll taxes. Cost of labor can be split up into direct or indirect costs. Direct costs are the labor costs associated with people who contribute to the primary process (an assembly line worker). Indirect costs cannot be traced to a specific level of production (a security person guarding the factory). • Training cost: Training cost represents the total amount that a company spends on training new hires and the existing workforce. • Recruitment cost: Total cost of recruitment efforts, often includes the costs of external agencies, advertisement and, sometimes, lost productivity. Entire books have been written on how to calculate this number. Read for more information here. • Time to fill: We’ve already touched upon time to fill. It’s the number of days between a position opening up and a candidate accepting that position. This metric will vary significantly between job types: software developers, big data analysts, and highly qualified salespeople are much harder to find than entry-level marketers for example. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788	27	Education	PT7M16S	436	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CAkAGWMBaqg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	46194	339	21	0	11

Break-even analysis is the study of what amount of sales, or units sold, is required to break even after incorporating all fixed and variable costs of running the operations of the business. Break-even analysis is critical in business planning and corporate finance, because assumptions about costs and potential sales determine if a company (or project) is on track to profitability. The break even point is very important to find business viability. Break-even analyses help business owners determine when they'll begin to turn a profit and helps them price their products with that in mind. It provides a dynamic overview of the relationships among revenues, costs and profits. However, typical variable and fixed costs differ widely among industries. This is why comparison of break-even points is generally most meaningful among companies within the same industry, and the definition of a "high" or "low" break-even point should be made within this context. The basic idea behind doing a break-even analysis is to calculate the point at which revenues begin to exceed costs. To do this, one must first separate a company's costs into those that are variable and those that are fixed. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the quantity of output and they are not zero when production is zero. Examples of fixed cost include rent, insurance premiums or loan payments. Variable costs are costs that change with the quantity of output. They are are zero when production is zero. Examples of common variable costs include labor directly involved in a company's manufacturing process and raw materials. What is a Break-Even Analysis? A break-even analysis is a useful tool for determining at what point your company, or a new product or service, will be profitable. Said another way, it’s a financial calculation used to determine the number of products or services you need to sell to at least cover your costs. When you’ve broken even, you are neither losing money nor making money, but all your costs have been covered. The Calculation The equation used to perform a break-even analysis is: Fixed costs/Price of product – Variable costs per unit Your fixed costs are the administrative expenses you incur by starting your business or developing a new product. Fixed costs are the same no matter how much you sell. They include things like: Rent Utilities Salaries Interest paid on debt Variable costs are expenses that increase with the production of products or services and include things like: Raw materials Distribution costs Packaging A break-even analysis is frequently used to assess the viability of a new business idea. Performing a break-even calculation can give you a general sense of whether the idea is worth pursuing. If your analysis suggests that you would have to sell 8,000 bottles of wine before you’d make a profit, and it will require an investment of $20,000 to get going, you can make a more informed decision regarding whether that’s how you want to invest your resources.

A Marketer is a specialist and professional who cooperates with a particular enterprise. Link to How to Become a Marketer https://education.templatemonster.com/en/marketer-en/ He/she usually analyses demand for goods, which are produced by this enterprise. Nowadays this profession is rather popular and in-demand. Marketers examine consumers’ tastes, preferences and interests; they promote different products and services, research demand, competition, forecasts, recommendations, etc. As you may have noticed, being a marketer is a rather complicated profession, but a really interesting one. Knowledge about marketing will be useful, even if you do not want to cooperate with any enterprise, but it will help promote your own business and achieve success for yourself. To make things easier, we have developed a special course, in which we are going to tell you everything about the most important and global aspects of marketing, which are indispensable. So, the topic of our first lesson is a sales funnel. What does that mean? It is this notion that defines an analytical tool, which determines the potential client’s path to a positive decision about the purchase of a product or service. It provides complete information about how he was actually guided at the time the decision was made. In this way, after examining all the information, you will be able to control and even “push” the potential customer to buy something without pressure. Because of the sales funnel you are provided with the opportunity to divide clients into separate branches or segments that will differ on the one hand, but, on the other, will contain clients who share the same or similar interests and needs. To build a clearer and more precise picture, let us consider this example. Suppose for just one moment that you have two potential clients. One of them still does not know which particular phone model he would like to buy, while the other one wants to buy an iPhone. On the surface, at first sight, we have 2 clients with similar needs, but the only difference here is the first client can change his mind right now, while the other is ready to pay in cash. We can analyze the specific stages through which customers pass before pressing the “BUY” button. Awareness is the first stage for a client. Here he realizes that he/she is really interested in the product or service that you offer. At this stage the potential purchaser tries to get to know as much as possible about the quality of the product. It means, that you must do your best to help clients get to know all the necessary and useful information about your service. After the client learns everything that he/she needs to make an informed decision, he/she becomes directly concerned by the product he/she would like to buy. At this stage the customer tries to perform side-by-side comparisons of different technologies offered by other stores. If the client is still interested in your products after making comparisons, he/she moves on to the next stage – solution and approval. Your content plays an important role at this particular stage, as it is this information which is able to persuade the future customer to buy this specific item from you or opts to choose another store. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT3M22S	202	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_GplOz6z88k/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1928	33	7	0	1

As you have already learned, there are 4 lessons in which you will be able to get to know everything about the various ways of earning money by being a freelancer. Link to How to Become a Freelancer Course https://education.templatemonster.com/en/freelancer-en/ It is important to note that we will not give you difficult tasks to complete. We will provide all the necessary information you will need to reach your goals. A Freelancer is a worker who is not tied to the format and constraints of one particular enterprise. Most often this person offers particular services online. These can be anything you could ever imagine: ranging from copywriting to more difficult aspects such as page making and programming. Where can you apply your talents? If you have never tried working freelance before, you should start with some easy tasks. Quite often novice freelancers try copywriting. This job is not really complicated and it is not that well paid, but it is perfect for gaining some experience and figuring out what the process is all about. Imagine that you are keen on writing interesting articles on a certain topic. Believe it or not, but this talent is the very talent you are going to need not only in copywriting but in preparing content for a website or your personal projects. Even if you have your own website, you need to know how to write unique, good quality and interesting content. If you have some skills in writing articles – more power to you. Choose the subject about which you would like to write. For example, if you are an inveterate car enthusiast, it will not be interesting for you to write about orchid cultivation, apart from the fact that you may not know anything about it. Choose a subject that interests you and try to write several articles on this very topic. Do not be afraid to show your articles to your mom, granny or your best friend if you are not sure about some specific aspects. Maybe these people will be able to help you and provide some good advice. Moreover they will help you to be more self-motivated and self-confident. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT3M21S	201	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPI9XXS63Nk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3111	50	8	0	1

A Blog is a type of web page which contains a news feed created by its owner. You can create such a web page yourself absolutely free. Link to the Course on How to become a blogger https://education.templatemonster.com/en/blogger-en/ It is necessary only to find a special platform on which to build your Blog and which you will find on the Internet for free. The first point in the creation of your personal blog is the idea. It must be followed by the specific goal for which you have created this resource. You must take it seriously, no matter whether you want to make money from it or just share your ideas. It is important to make your blog exciting. Try to choose something which will be interesting both for you and your subscribers. Everybody knows that if there is an interest for specific material, there will be a demand for it too. If you have a certain kind of hobby, that’s a good start for you. It means that you already have a stable basis for work. All you need to do is tell people about your job, your path to success, interesting involvement in some business etc. Dealing with a blog you must know that there are 2 types of content: entertaining and educational. This fact can help you to choose a theme for your resource. If you choose an entertaining one, it is necessary to understand that the main rule here is regularity. You may tell your followers everything you want or you are interested in. Moreover you don’t need to prepare for the release for a long time comparing with the educational channels. As for the educational ones, the main privilege is the popularity among people of different age. Nowadays people are in search of different tutorials. IT-technologies is one of the most popular inquiries. Many people are not ready to pay much money for such courses. This is the reason why they look for free material. People are interested in the process of creating websites, layout, design, etc. and it is the reason for people to create YouTube channels with tutorials on this topic. It is not important to make several releases per week comparing with entertaining channels. If you choose the topic which is connected with internet, web sites creation, for example, you may shoot one video per week with announcing the subject of the next release. In such a way your followers will understand what they are waiting for. While writing educational articles or shooting such kind of videos, it is necessary to use key words due to which people will be able to find your material and these videos and articles will be optimized for search engines. It means that if you write about IT-technologies, web design and so on, you need to use concrete words. We would like to offer you some key words which may be useful for your articles. There are even special resources which are able to generate correct and effective key words. Next step is the choice of layout of your blog. It depends upon the style and the format of articles you are going to post. If the majority of your followers is the youth, you can organise everything in a friendly manner to be indirectly closer to them. If your blog is dedicated to some serious themes and people – all the articles there must be designed in a correspondingly suitable and more mature way. After you have chosen the subject of your future blog, it means that you must look for an appropriate platform for it. At this stage it is not necessary to buy expensive websites. At the very beginning there is no urgent need to do it, if you haven’t yet realized exactly with what topic you would like to deal. That’s why you need to search for free platforms for blogs, which you can use to develop your skills in writing and organizing everything. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT2M51S	171	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TuiZWtxRwKg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	4079	39	11	0	8

The cash flow statement components provide a detailed view of cash flow from operations, investing, and financing: Cash Flow from Operating Activities The net amount of cash coming in or leaving from the day to day business operations of an entity is called Cash Flow From Operations. Basically it is the operating income plus non-cash items such as depreciation added. Since accounting profits are reduced by non-cash items (i.e. depreciation and amortization) they must be added back to accounting profits to calculate cash flow. Cash flow from operations is an important measurement because it tells the analyst about the viability of an entities current business plan and operations. In the long run, cash flow from operations must be cash inflows in order for an entity to be solvent and provide for the normal outflows from investing and finance activities. Cash Flow From Investing Activities Cash flow from investing activities would include the outflow of cash for long term assets such as land, buildings, equipment, etc., and the inflows from the sale of assets, businesses, securities, etc. Most cash flow investing activities are cash out flows because most entities make long term investments for operations and future growth. Cash Flow From Finance Activities Cash flow from finance activities is the cash out flow to the entities investors (i.e. interest to bondholders) and shareholders (i.e. dividends and stock buybacks) and cash inflows from sales of bonds or issuance of stock equity. Most cash flow finance activities are cash outflows since most entities only issue bonds and stocks occasionally. Cash Flow Statement Format Operating Activities: Net Income Depreciation and Amortization +/- One Time Adjustments (i.e. investment gains or losses not related to operations, deferred taxes, stock compensation) +/- Changes in Working Capital Cash Flow From Operations Investing Activities: +/- Net Capital Expenditures +/- Net Investments Cash Flow From Investing Activities Financing Activities – dividends +/- sale or purchase of company stock +/- net borrowings Cash Flow From Financing Activities Summary of Cash Flow Activities: +/- Cash Flow From Operating Activities +/- Cash Flow From Investing Activities +/- Cash Flow From Financing Activities Net Change in Cash Beginning Cash Balance Ending Cash Balance Note: You should be able to reconcile the Net Change in Cash with the cash balances reported on the Balance Sheet. Investment Analysis Summary The cash inflows and cash outflows in the cash flow statement are segmented into cash flow from operations, investing, and financing. These details provide insight in the liquidity and solvency, as well the entities ability to meet future needs for capital and growth. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT7M8S	428	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S2CwI9l6v18/maxresdefault.jpg	1	14890	152	11	0	13

The Mod Function finds the remainder of the value if divided by 2 so in case of odd numbers the remainder of Odd number will be 1 and then the Sumproduct will be used to find the count of cells having odd values in them. Download file from http://www.myelesson.org/downloads Advantage of using the SumProduct function to find the odd values is that it compensates for possible blank cells in your range.

In its simplest form, the IF function Excel says: IF(Something is True, then do something, otherwise do something else) So in Excel IF statement can have two results. The first result is if your comparison is True, the second if your comparison is False. Learn about IF Formula in Excel Build your knowledge of IF Statement with this Excel tutorial. Technical details of If Function Use the IF condition in Excel, one of the logical functions, to return one value if a condition is true and another value if it's false. How to use if function in excel As you see, the IF function can be used to evaluate both text and values as an excel logical test. It can also be used to evaluate errors. You are not limited to only checking if one thing is equal to another and returning a single result, you can also use mathematical operators and perform additional calculations depending on your criteria. You can also nest multiple if command in excel together in order to perform multiple comparisons. If you are going to use text in formulas, you need to wrap the text in quotes (e.g. “Text”). The only exception to that is using TRUE or FALSE, which Excel automatically understands. How to get started with the if Formula in Excel The best way to start writing an IF statement is to think about what you are trying to accomplish. What comparison are you trying to make? Many times, writing an IF statement can be as simple as thinking through the logic in your head: “what should happen if this condition is met vs. what should happen if it’s not?” You will always want to make sure that your steps follow a logical progression, or else your formula won’t do what you think it should. This is especially important when you create complex (nested) IF statements. Best Practices - Constants It is generally not a good practice to put literal constants (values that may need to change from time to time) directly into formulas, because they can be hard to find and change in the future. It’s much better to put constants into their own cells, where they are out in the open and easily found and changed. In this case, it’s OK, because there’s only one IF function and the Sales Tax Rate will rarely change. Even if it does, it will be easy to change it in the formula. Calculation operators If you want to learn more about the different calculation operators you can use in formulas, ( less than, greater than, = equals, not equal to, etc.) A word of caution While Excel will allow you to nest up to 64 different IF functions, it’s not at all advisable to do so. Why? Multiple IF statements require a great deal of thought to build them correctly and make sure that their logic can calculate correctly through each condition all the way to the end. If you don’t nest your IF statements 100% accurately, then a formula might work 75% of the time, but return unexpected results 25% of the time. Unfortunately, the odds of you catching the 25% is slim. Multiple IF statements can become very difficult to maintain, especially when you come back some time later and try to figure out what you, or worse someone else, was trying to do. Multiple IF statements require multiple open and closing parentheses (), which can be difficult to manage depending on how complex your formula becomes. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT9M5S	545	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RRoWhc1hhU/maxresdefault.jpg	1	4234	97	2	0	19

What is a purchase order? A purchase order (PO) is the official confirmation of an order. It is a document sent from a purchaser to a vendor that authorizes a purchase. A PO confirms that an order has been placed PO includes order details, mailing information, and price, vendor contact information, payment adjustments (credits or discounts), payment schedule, and the total amount due to the vendor. Why do companies use purchase orders? Purchase orders are used for several reasons: They set clear expectations POs enable purchasers to clarify their needs to vendors. Both parties can use them in case orders are not delivered as expected. They help manage orders POs give procurement, finance, and operations teams official documentation of incoming or pending deliveries, enabling them to track and manage orders more effectively. They help with budgeting Once a PO is created, purchasers can factor these costs into company budgets and therefore, spend more wisely. They are legally binding In the absence of a formal contract, a PO can serve as a legally binding document, but only after it is accepted by the vendor. They are a key part of audit trails Auditors are on the lookout for financial discrepancies. Issuing, processing, and recording POs ensures you have what you need to fend off auditors. The benefits above are geared towards purchasers, but POs are important documents for vendors as well. Vendors use them for order fulfillment and payment processing. Read our PO Process blog post to learn when businesses need purchase orders and when they don’t. ** Useful Excel formulas and Functions ** 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT3M11S	191	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8aNzWSYvgI4/maxresdefault.jpg	1	33388	296	29	0	15

Originally, opportūnus was probably used of winds with the literal meaning of "blowing in the direction of a harbor." The word is a combination of the prefix ob-, meaning "to," and portus, "port" or "harbor." Latin portus is also at the root of English port. Opportune and port both made their way to English via Anglo-French, with port arriving before the 12th century, and opportune arriving in the 15th century. Examples "Kristin seized upon the first opportune moment to approach her boss about a raise." "he couldn't have arrived at a less opportune moment" 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy	27	Education	PT1M42S	102	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D1BXmc9UggE/maxresdefault.jpg	1	542	32	0	0	4

There are 4 Excel formulas that we can use to extract names in excel. 1- Left Formula 2 - Mid Formula 3 - Right Formula 4 - Len Formula To split middle name in Excel, the main idea is to find the spaces between the first name and the last name. Once that is done then it become easy to split words or extract words in excel. Extract First name in Excel The first name starts with the first character from the left (E) and ends at the fifth character (the first space). The formula extracts the first five characters in A2, starting from the left. Formula for separating a first and last name, plus middle initial Use the SEARCH function to find the value for num_chars: Search for the numeric position of the space in A2, starting from the left. (5) Split Middle name in Excel The middle name starts at the sixth character position (S), and ends at the eighth position (the second space). This formula involves nesting SEARCH functions to find the second instance of a space. The formula extracts three characters, starting from the sixth position. Details of a formula for separating first, middle, and last names Use the SEARCH function to find the value for start_num: Search for the numeric position of the first space in A2, starting from the first character from the left. (5). Add 1 to get the position of the character after the first space (S). This numeric position is the starting position of the middle name. (5 + 1 = 6) Use nested SEARCH functions to find the value for num_chars: Search for the numeric position of the first space in A2, starting from the first character from the left. (5) Add 1 to get the position of the character after the first space (S). The result is the character number at which you want to start searching for the second instance of space. (5 + 1 = 6) Search for the second instance of space in A2, starting from the sixth position (S) found in step 4. This character number is the ending position of the middle name. (8) Search for the numeric position of space in A2, starting from the first character from the left. (5) Take the character number of the second space found in step 5 and subtract the character number of the first space found in step 6. The result is the number of characters MID extracts from the text string starting at the sixth position found in step 2. (8 – 5 = 3) Split Last name in Excel The last name starts six characters from the right (K) and ends at the first character from the right (n). This formula involves nesting SEARCH functions to find the second and third instances of a space (which are at the fifth and eighth positions from the left). The formula extracts six characters in A2, starting from the right. The second SEARCH function in a formula for separating first, middle, and last names Use the LEN and nested SEARCH functions to find the value for num_chars: Search for the numeric position of space in A2, starting from the first character from the left. (5) Add 1 to get the position of the character after the first space (S). The result is the character number at which you want to start searching for the second instance of space. (5 + 1 = 6) Search for the second instance of space in A2, starting from the sixth position (S) found in step 2. This character number is the ending position of the middle name. (8) Count the total length of the text string in A2, and then subtract the number of characters from the left up to the second instance of space found in step 3. The result is the number of characters to be extracted from the right of the full name. (14 – 8 = 6).

Unfortunately, you can’t do this in Excel. Instead, create a new column next to the column that has the cell you want to split and then split the cell. You can also split the contents of a cell into multiple adjacent cells. You can use the LEFT, MID, RIGHT, SEARCH, and LEN text functions to manipulate strings of text in your data. For example, you can distribute the first, middle, and last names from a single cell into three separate columns. The key to distributing name components with text functions is the position of each character within a text string. The positions of the spaces within the text string are also important because they indicate the beginning or end of name components in a string. For example, in a cell that contains only a first and last name, the last name begins after the first instance of a space. Some names in your list may contain a middle name, in which case, the last name begins after the second instance of a space.

Syntax AVERAGEIFS(average_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...) The AVERAGEIFS function syntax has the following arguments: • Average_range Required. One or more cells to average, including numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers. • Criteria_range1, criteria_range2, … Criteria_range1 is required, subsequent criteria_ranges are optional. 1 to 127 ranges in which to evaluate the associated criteria. • Criteria1, criteria2, ... Criteria1 is required, subsequent criteria are optional. 1 to 127 criteria in the form of a number, expression, cell reference, or text that define which cells will be averaged. For example, criteria can be expressed as 32, "32", "32", "apples", or B4. Remarks • If average_range is a blank or text value, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV0! error value. • If a cell in a criteria range is empty, AVERAGEIFS treats it as a 0 value. • Cells in range that contain TRUE evaluate as 1; cells in range that contain FALSE evaluate as 0 (zero). • Each cell in average_range is used in the average calculation only if all of the corresponding criteria specified are true for that cell. • Unlike the range and criteria arguments in the AVERAGEIF function, in AVERAGEIFS each criteria_range must be the same size and shape as sum_range. • If cells in average_range cannot be translated into numbers, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV0! error value. • If there are no cells that meet all the criteria, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV/0! error value. • You can use the wildcard characters, question mark (?) and asterisk (*), in criteria. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) before the character.

In its simplest form, the IF function says: IF(Something is True, then do something, otherwise do something else) So an IF statement can have two results. The first result is if your comparison is True, the second if your comparison is False. Build your knowledge of IF logical tests with LinkedIn Learning. Learn how to use one of Excel's most powerful functions. IF function can be used to evaluate both text and values. It can also be used to evaluate errors. You are not limited to only checking if one thing is equal to another and returning a single result, you can also use mathematical operators and perform additional calculations depending on your criteria. You can also nest multiple IF functions together in order to perform multiple comparisons. The best way to start writing an IF statement is to think about what you are trying to accomplish. What comparison are you trying to make? Many times, writing an IF statement can be as simple as thinking through the logic in your head: “what should happen if this condition is met vs. what should happen if it’s not?” You will always want to make sure that your steps follow a logical progression, or else your formula won’t do what you think it should. This is especially important when you create complex (nested) IF statements. While Excel will allow you to nest up to 64 different IF functions, it’s not at all advisable to do so. Why? Multiple IF statements require a great deal of thought to build them correctly and make sure that their logic can calculate correctly through each condition all the way to the end. If you don’t nest your IF statements 100% accurately, then a formula might work 75% of the time, but return unexpected results 25% of the time. Unfortunately, the odds of you catching the 25% is slim. Multiple IF statements can become very difficult to maintain, especially when you come back some time later and try to figure out what you, or worse someone else, was trying to do. Multiple IF statements require multiple open and closing parentheses (), which can be difficult to manage depending on how complex your formula becomes.

Let's say you want to find the average number of days to complete a milestone in a project or the average temperature on a particular day over a 10-year time span. There are several ways to calculate the average of a group of numbers. The AVERAGE function measures central tendency, which is the location of the center of a group of numbers in a statistical distribution. The three most common measures of central tendency are: Average which is the arithmetic mean, and is calculated by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers. For example, the average of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 30 divided by 6, which is 5. Median which is the middle number of a group of numbers; that is, half the numbers have values that are greater than the median, and half the numbers have values that are less than the median. For example, the median of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 4. Mode which is the most frequently occurring number in a group of numbers. For example, the mode of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 3. For a symmetrical distribution of a group of numbers, these three measures of central tendency are all the same. For a skewed distribution of a group of numbers, they can be different. Calculate the average of numbers in a contiguous row or column Click a cell below or to the right of the numbers for which you want to find the average On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the arrow next to Button image AutoSum , click Average, and then press ENTER. Calculate the average of numbers not in a contiguous row or column To do this task, use the AVERAGE function.

Respect is something not automatically given. It must be earned. When you’re in a leadership position, it is imperative that the people with whom you work respect you. They might respect your work habits, your intelligence, or your ability to close a deal. Yet, there’s more to respect than that. If you can earn their respect as a person, then you’ve really won the game. Here are some tips for earning more respect. 1. Be polite Always be polite to everyone you meet during the day, from your family members to your co-workers, to the checkout person at the grocery store. Give others the same respect you’d like to receive yourself. Seek out actions you can take to offer politeness. Open the door at the coffee shop for the person behind you, or let the person with one item go ahead of you in the grocery store. Say please and thank you whenever possible. 2. Act respectfully Eliminate disrespectful behaviors such as rolling your eyes, interrupting or talking negatively about someone. Not only are these actions not respectful of the person you’re interacting with, they deter or prevent further involvement or resolution of issues, and create a wedge that can become permanent. Instead, foster an environment of respectful listening. Everyone deserves to be heard, even if you don’t agree with a person’s views or opinions. Consider how you’d like to be treated if you have something to say, especially if there is an important issue at hand. 3. Listen well Listening is an active process, not a passive one. Think before you speak. Most often in today’s conversations, one person’s comments “trigger” thoughts in the listener, who then brings forth their own story along the same lines. Instead of telling your tale, ask questions that encourage the speaker to tell you more. Most people will be flattered that you care. 4. Be helpful People earn respect by always being ready to lend a hand or an ear whenever they’re needed or notice an opportunity to help. Look for opportunities to help that you might have previously overlooked. Does a co-worker need help with a big project? Can you grab a cup of coffee for someone? Strive to be helpful several times a day. 5. Don’t make excuses Your actions are based on your choices, and barring some unforeseen circumstance, there is no reason for excuses. Own your actions. For example, if you’re constantly late, don’t make lame excuses. Own up to your mistakes and instead of dwelling on them, look for opportunities to move past them and do better next time. Instead of focusing on your shortcomings, ask, “How can I rectify my behavior or situation?” 6. Let go of anger Holding on to anger or a grudge doesn’t hurt anyone but yourself. If you get upset, allow yourself to be angry momentarily, then move on and either rectify the situation or put it behind you. Give yourself and others a break. Forgive, and then forget. 7. Be willing to change Being intractable won’t get you anywhere. Realize that the process of evolution includes change. Make an effort to grow as a person; learn new skills, try new activities, and especially, re-examine your automatic behaviors. And don’t forget to congratulate yourself on progress you make along the way to becoming a better person.

380	UCtGMoQ5di1i0yswzxVbQujw	My E-Lesson	J4Dr90gLlMs	2018-01-04T09:16:04Z	2018-01-04 09:16:04	Remove Duplicates in Excel Hindi	Remove Duplicates in Excel Hindi Remove Duplicate Values in Excel   In Excel, you have several ways to filter for unique values or remove duplicate values: To filter for unique values, use the Advanced command in the Sort & Filter group on the Data tab. To remove duplicate values, use the Remove Duplicates command in the Data Tools group on the Datatab. To highlight unique or duplicate values, use the Conditional Formatting command in the Style group on the Home tab. Learn about filtering for unique values or removing duplicate values Filtering for unique values and removing duplicate values are two closely related tasks because the displayed results are the same — a list of unique values. The difference, however, is important: When you filter for unique values, you temporarily hide duplicate values, but when you remove duplicate values, you permanently delete duplicate values. A duplicate value is one where all values in the row are an exact match of all the values in another row. Duplicate values are determined by the value displayed in the cell and not necessarily the value stored in the cell. For example, if you have the same date value in different cells, one formatted as "3/8/2006" and the other as "Mar 8, 2006", the values are unique. It's a good idea to filter for or conditionally format unique values first to confirm that the results are what you want before removing duplicate values. Filter for unique values Select the range of cells, or make sure the active cell is in a table. On the Data tab, in the Sort & Filter group, click Advanced. In the Advanced Filter dialog box, do one of the following: To filter the range of cells or table in place, click Filter the list, in-place. To copy the results of the filter to another location, do the following: Click Copy to another location. In the Copy to box, enter a cell reference. Alternatively, click Collapse Dialog  to temporarily hide the dialog box, select a cell on the worksheet, and then press Expand Dialog  . Select the Unique records only check box, and click OK. The unique values from the selected range are copied to the new location. Remove duplicate values When you remove duplicate values, only the values in the range of cells or table are affected. Any other values outside the range of cells or table are not altered or moved. Because you are permanently deleting data, it's a good idea to copy the original range of cells or table to another worksheet or workbook before removing duplicate values. Select the range of cells, or make sure that the active cell is in a table. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Remove Duplicates. Do one or more of the following: Under Columns, select one or more columns. To quickly select all columns, click Select All. To quickly clear all columns, click Unselect All. If the range of cells or table contains many columns and you want to only select a few columns, you may find it easier to click Unselect All, and then under Columns, select those columns. Click OK. A message is displayed indicating how many duplicate values were removed and how many unique values remain, or if no duplicate values were removed. Click OK. Issue: I'm having problems removing duplicate values from data that is outlined or that has subtotals. You cannot remove duplicate values from data that is outlined or that has subtotals. To remove duplicates, you must remove both the outline and the subtotals. For more information, see Outline a list of data in a worksheet and Remove subtotals. Conditionally format unique or duplicate values Note: You cannot conditionally format fields in the Values area of a PivotTable report by unique or duplicate values. Quick formatting Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report. On the Home tab, in the Style group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Highlight Cells Rules. Select Duplicate Values. Enter the values that you want to use, and then select a format. Advanced formatting Select one or more cells in a range, table, or PivotTable report. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click the arrow next to Conditional Formatting, and then click Manage Rules. The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box is displayed. Do one of the following: To add a conditional format, click New Rule. The New Formatting Rule dialog box is displayed.

You can protect your Excel file with a password to prevent others from accessing data in your Excel files. This topic covers the two different ways you can protect an Excel file — using encryption, and the setting a password to open/modify an Excel file.  Microsoft can’t retrieve forgotten passwords. There are no restrictions on the passwords you use with regards to length, characters or numbers, but passwords are case-sensitive. It’s not always secure to distribute password-protected files that contain sensitive information such as credit card numbers. Be cautious when sharing files or passwords with other users. You still run the risk of passwords them falling into the hands of unintended users. Remember that locking a file with a password does not necessarily protect your file from malicious intent. Encrypt an Excel file When you encrypt an Excel file, you lock it with a password. Once you encrypt an Excel file, no one else will be able to open it. This is the most common and recommended technique to lock an Excel file. Follow these steps to encrypt an Excel file: Click File - Info - Protect Workbook - Encrypt with Password . Enter a password, and click OK. In the Confirm Password dialog box, reenter the password you entered in the previous step. When you/another user tries to open the file, the following screen appears: Set a password to allow reading or modifying You can set two passwords on the file - one to open the file as read-only, and the other to modify. Then you can share the appropriate passwords with the users depending on the access level they should have. Read-only access does not prevent someone from making changes to a file, but it does prevent them from saving those changes unless they rename the file and save it as something other than the original. For users who need to be able to modify the file, you will have to share both open and modify passwords. Follow these steps to set a password to open/modify an Excel file: Note: In the Mac, go to File - Save As - Options, and then set the password to open or modify the file. Select Read Only if you want users to open the file as Read-only. In the Excel file, click File - Save As. Click a location, such as Computer or your My Site web page. Click a folder, such as Documents or one of the folders on your OneDrive, or click Browse. In the Save As dialog box, go to the folder you want to use, then click Tools and then click General Options. You can specify one or both passwords here, one to open the file, another to modify the file, depending on your requirements. Click Save. When someone tries to open this file, Excel prompts for a password. A second screen shows if there is a password to modify the file. Users who don’t have the modify password can click Read Only and start viewing the contents of the file.   How can I tell if a file is protected? Click File - Info - Protect Workbook to see this protection status.   Disable encryption in an Excel file In your Excel file, click File - Info - Protect Workbook, and then click Encrypt with Password. Delete the password excel and click OK.   Remove passwords in excel You can change or remove passwords in excel that are set for opening/modifying an Excel file, by following the same procedure as setting the passwords. Simply delete the password you set in the General Options box.   The video has been made by me and the text has been taken from a Microsoft Blog    To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 Connect with us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/excelmadeasy/ Connect with us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/Excelmadeasy 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT5M44S	344	2d	hd	false		1	4779	243	2	0	53

There are four pieces of information that you will need in order to build the VLOOKUP syntax: The value you want to look up, also called the lookup value. The range where the lookup value is located. Remember that the lookup value should always be in the first column in the range for VLOOKUP to work correctly. For example, if your lookup value is in cell C2 then your range should start with C. The column number in the range that contains the return value. For example, if you specify B2: D11 as the range, you should count B as the first column, C as the second, and so on. Optionally, you can specify TRUE if you want an approximate match or FALSE if you want an exact match of the return value. If you don't specify anything, the default value will always be TRUE or approximate match. Now put all of the above together as follows: =VLOOKUP(lookup value, range containing the lookup value, the column number in the range containing the return value, optionally specify TRUE for approximate match or FALSE for an exact match).

If you want to become a leader then you would benefit by forming these 8 habits of leaders 1. They strive to better themselves. You'll never find true leaders growing complacent. They're voracious learners, constantly expanding their skills and knowledge by reading, networking, or trying things. Don't underestimate the power of reading. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett, and other extraordinary leaders make daily reading a big priority. Here's a list of top books you should read for business and personal success. 2. They surround themselves with achievers. Leaders associate with achievers who inspire them to live a fulfilled life. Remember what entrepreneur and motivational speaker Jim Rohn once said: "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with." It makes sense when pursuing greatness to surround yourself with people of similar character and ambition. And of course, avoid surrounding yourself with negative people. 3. They accept that improvement is a process. Exceptional leaders are patient. They don't expect to achieve significant results all at once. Rather, they know that incremental steps taken each day will lead to growth over time. The best leaders don't overestimate what they can do in the short term or underestimate what they can produce over time. 4. They're open to feedback. Successful people solicit input and advice along the way as part of the self-improvement process. They take responsibility for their performance and have the self-awareness to incorporate feedback. This can be feedback from people, customers, and investors. It is also important for leaders to learn from their mistakes and realize there are gifts in failure. 5. They resist dogma. Strong leaders have the self-confidence to challenge their own assumptions and biases -- and those of others around them. They think for themselves and typically resist following others (which is not the same as not listening to others). Strong leaders know that biases and rigid definitions today become land mines in the future. 6. They face their fears head-on. Leaders acknowledge that their ambitions usually involve some level of fear or self-doubt. Bottom line: They won't always feel good, but they move forward anyway. Driving forward in the face of fear and uncertainty is often what separates the best from the rest. 7. They believe in their vision. A startup is a group of people who believe in a future that doesn't yet exist. Great leaders reach a high level of clarity around their vision and cultivate a strong-enough belief to motivate others to join the mission. 8. They think long-term. The most successful entrepreneurs know better than to live and die by every day. They plan long-term, constantly visualizing future versions of themselves and their business. They know that small steps will add up to bigger things. They know how to balance present-day urgencies while protecting the future.

Download Link for Codeblocks http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26 Our Other Free Courses http://www.myelesson.org What is C Language C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,[ and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. सी को मूल रूप से 1 9 6 9 से 1 9 73 के बीच बेल लैब्स, [5] के बीच डेनिस रिची ने विकसित किया था और यूनिक्स ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम को फिर से लागू करने के लिए इस्तेमाल किया गया था। [6] इसके बाद से सभी समय की सबसे अधिक व्यापक रूप से प्रयुक्त प्रोग्रामिंग भाषाओं में से एक बन गया है, [7] [8] मौजूदा कंप्यूटर आर्किटेक्चर और ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम के अधिकांश के लिए उपलब्ध विभिन्न विक्रेताओं से सी कंपाइलर्स के साथ। सी को अमेरिकी राष्ट्रीय मानक संस्थान (एएनएसआई) द्वारा 1989 (एएनएसआई सी देखें) और बाद में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय संगठन के मानकीकरण (आईएसओ) द्वारा मानकीकृत किया गया है। सी एक अनिवार्य प्रक्रियात्मक भाषा है यह एक अपेक्षाकृत सीधा कम्पाइलर का उपयोग करके संकलित किया गया था, ताकि स्मृति के लिए निम्न-स्तर तक पहुंच प्रदान की जा सके, जिससे मशीन निर्देशों के लिए कुशलतापूर्वक मानचित्रित भाषा निर्माण और न्यूनतम रन-टाइम समर्थन की आवश्यकता हो। अपनी निम्न-स्तरीय क्षमताओं के बावजूद, भाषा को क्रॉस-प्लेटफ़ॉर्म प्रोग्रामिंग को प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया था। एक मानक-अनुपालन और पोर्टेबल लिखित सी प्रोग्राम को बहुत ही विविध प्रकार के कंप्यूटर प्लेटफॉर्म और ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम के लिए संकलित किया जा सकता है जिसमें इसके स्रोत कोड में कुछ बदलाव हैं। यह भाषा बहुत व्यापक प्लेटफार्मों पर उपलब्ध हो गई है, जो एम्बेडेड माइक्रोकंट्रोलर्स से लेकर सुपर कंप्यूटर पर उपलब्ध हो गई है। It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Download Link for Codeblocks http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26 Our Other Free Courses http://www.myelesson.org C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

A Pivot Table report is especially useful when you have a long list of figures to sum, and aggregated data or subtotals would help you look at the data from different perspectives and compare figures of similar data. Create a Pivot Table to analyze worksheet data Being able to quickly analyze data can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes it’s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. Pivot Tables are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your data, and you can create them with just a few clicks. Pivot Tables are highly flexible and can be quickly adjusted depending on how you need to display your results. You can also create Pivot Charts based on Pivot Tables that will automatically update when your Pivot Tables do. Tips to make Pivot Tables in Excel Hindi You data should be organized in a tabular format, and not have any blank rows or columns. Ideally, you can use an Excel table like in our example above. Tables are a great Pivot Table data source, because rows added to a table are automatically included in the Pivot Table when you refresh the data, and any new columns will be included in the Pivot Table Fields List. Otherwise, you need to either manually update the data source range, or use a dynamic named range formula. Data types in columns should be the same. For example, you shouldn't mix dates and text in the same column. Pivot Tables work on a snapshot of your data, called the cache, so your actual data doesn't get altered in any way.

An external reference (also called a link) is a reference to a cell or range on a worksheet in another Excel workbook, or a reference to a defined name in another workbook. You can refer to the specific cell range, a defined name for the cell range, or define a name for the external reference. If you use a cell reference to create an external reference, you can then also apply formulas to the information. By switching between the various types of cell reference, you can also control which cells are linked to if you move the external reference. For example, if you use a relative reference, when you move the external reference, the cell or cells that it links to change to reflect its new position on the worksheet. When you create an external reference from one workbook to another workbook, you should use a name to refer to the cells that you are linking to. You can create an external reference by using a name that is already defined, or you can define the name when you create the external reference. By using a name, it is easier to remember the contents of the cells that you are linking to. External references that use defined names do not change when you move them because a name refers to a specific cell or range of cells. If you want an external reference that uses a defined name to change when you move it, you can change the name that is used in the external reference, or you can change the cells that the name refers to.

Being able to quickly analyze data can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes it’s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. PivotTables are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your data, and you can create them with just a few clicks. PivotTables are highly flexible and can be quickly adjusted depending on how you need to display your results. You can also create PivotCharts based on PivotTables that will automatically update when your PivotTables do. Create a PivotTable If you have limited experience with PivotTables, or are not sure how to get started, a Recommended PivotTable is a good choice. When you use this feature, Excel determines a meaningful layout by matching the data with the most suitable areas in the PivotTable. This helps give you a starting point for additional experimentation. After a recommended PivotTable is created, you can explore different orientations and rearrange fields to achieve your specific results. Before you get started Your data should be organized in a tabular format, and not have any blank rows or columns. Ideally, you can use an Excel table like in our example above. Tables are a great PivotTable data source, because rows added to a table are automatically included in the PivotTable when you refresh the data, and any new columns will be included in the PivotTable Fields List. Otherwise, you need to either manually update the data source range, or use a dynamic named range formula. Data types in columns should be the same. For example, you shouldn't mix dates and text in the same column. PivotTables work on a snapshot of your data, called the cache, so your actual data doesn't get altered in any way.

To lookup image in Excel with formula and make impressive dashboards, data sheets in Excel. I have used the Index and Match formula to lookup picture in Excel. Photo Lookup in Excel was almost impossible but with trick you can easily lookup any picture in Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel,2013 and Excel 2016. You can download the Excel file from this link http://www.myelesson.org/excel-training-videos/lookup-picture-excel In this example i have used Index and Match formula to lookup the marks and images of students with the help of Dropdown list and Name Manager features in Excel Steps to Lookup Picture in Excel Setup up data - Place Images next to names of people Use Index and Match Formula to fetch marks for names  Use Name Manager to define a name for Picture Holder Copy formula used in Step 3 to in the Name Manager range Copy anyone image in the Picture Holder  Link image to the name defined in step 4  In Excel, you can lookup an image from a data set in the same way as you extract a value using a lookup formula in Excel.  Download the Excel template for Looking up Picture with Formula in Excel from this link  http://www.myelesson.org/excel-training-videos/lookup-picture-excel How it Works In the formula the name that we defined in the Name Manger would return a cell reference because we have used a combination of Index and Match formula The MATCH formula gives the position of the Student in the drop down.The INDEX formula finds the cell reference that contains the image of the Student using the potion provided by the Match formula. The Named ranges linked to images returns the image correlating to the reference returned by the Index and Match formula due to this whenever you select the name of a student from the dropdown then the correlating image is updated next to it.

Yes you can add animation effects in powerpoint to make images move in specific directions and make it look like a actual animation movie. You can animate the text, pictures, shapes, tables, SmartArt graphics, and other objects in your PowerPoint presentation to give them visual effects, including entrances, exits, changes in size or color, and even movement. Build a slide presentation that animates bullet points or even production credits. Animation is a great way to emphasize a point, control information flow, and increase viewer interest. You can apply animation effects on individual slides, the slide master, or custom slide layouts. 4:05 For related information, see Make words appear one line at a time. (In PowerPoint, animations are not the same as transitions. A transition animates the way one slide changes to the next. To add a transition, see Add, change, or remove transitions between slides.) 2016, 201320102007 Add animation to an object Select the object that you want to animate. An "object" in this context is any thing on a slide, such as a picture, a chart, or a text box. Sizing handles appear around an object when you select it on the slide. (For animation purposes, a paragraph within a text box is also an object, but it won't have sizing handles when you select it; instead the entire text box has sizing handles.) On the Animations tab of the ribbon, in the Animation group, click the More Button image button, and then select the animation effect that you want. The Animation group on the Animations tab. If you do not see the entrance, exit, emphasis, or motion path animation affect that you want, click More Entrance Effects, More Emphasis Effects, More Exit Effects, or More Motion Paths. Some entrance and exit effects (such as Flip, Drop, and Whip) and some emphasis effects (such as Brush Color and Wave) are available only for objects that contain text. If you want to apply an animation effect that isn't available for this reason, try adding a space inside your object. After you have applied an animation to an object or text, the animated items are labeled on the slide with a non-printing numbered tag, displayed near the text or object. The tag appears only in Normal view when the Animations tab is selected or the Animation task pane is visible. Change the speed of the animation effect The speed of the effect is determined by the Duration setting. On the slide, select the animation effect that you want to change. On the Animations tab, under Timing options, in the Duration box, enter the number seconds that you want the animation effect to last. Timing options for animations in PowerPoint (Maximum: 59 seconds. Minimum: .01 seconds. You can type a duration or use the up or down arrows to select a standard incremental value.) Change how the animation effect starts On the slide, select the animation effect that you want to change. On the Animations tab, under Timing options, open the Start list, and choose one of the three options described below: To start the animation effect Select When you click the slide On Click At the same time as the previous animation effect in the list. (One click starts two or more animation effects at the same time.) With Previous Immediately after the previous animation effect in the list finishes playing. (No additional click is required to make this animation effect start.) After Previous Start options for animations in PowerPoint Set the time between animation effects The Delay option determines how much time elapses before a specific animation effect begins—either after you click or after a prior animation effect concludes. Change the order of the animation effects on a slide To reorder a set of animations on a slide: Open the Animation pane: On the Animations tab, in the Advanced Animation group, select Animation Pane. In the Animation pane, select the animation effect that you want to reorder.

Don't live a limited life 2. Have passion 3. Design for yourself 4. Don't sell crap 5. Build a great team 6. Don't do it for the money 7. Be proud of your products 8. Build around customers 9. Marketing is about Values 10.Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption. Smart but directionless, Jobs experimented with different pursuits before starting Apple Computer with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology, with Jobs having left the company in 1985 and returning more than a decade later. He died in 2011, following a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Apple Computer In 1976, when Jobs was just 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computer. The duo started in the Jobs family garage, funding their entrepreneurial venture by Jobs selling his Volkswagen bus and Wozniak selling his beloved scientific calculator. Jobs and Wozniak are credited with revolutionizing the computer industry by democratizing the technology and making machines smaller, cheaper, intuitive and accessible to everyday consumers. Wozniak conceived of a series of user-friendly personal computers, and—with Jobs in charge of marketing—Apple initially marketed the computers for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned the corporation around $774,000. Three years after the release of Apple's second model, the Apple II, the company's sales increased by 700 percent to $139 million. In 1980, Apple Computer became a publicly traded company, with a market value of $1.2 billion by the end of its very first day of trading. Jobs looked to marketing expert John Sculley of Pepsi-Cola to take over the role of CEO for Apple. Departure from Company However, the next several products from Apple suffered significant design flaws, resulting in recalls and consumer disappointment. IBM suddenly surpassed Apple in sales, and Apple had to compete with an IBM/PC-dominated business world. In 1984, Apple released the Macintosh, marketing the computer as a piece of a counterculture lifestyle: romantic, youthful, creative. But despite positive sales and performance superior to IBM's PCs, the Macintosh was still not IBM-compatible. Sculley believed Jobs was hurting Apple, and the company's executives began to phase him out. Not actually having had an official title with the company he co-founded, Jobs was pushed into a more marginalized position and thus left Apple in 1985 to begin a new hardware and software enterprise called NeXT, Inc. The following year Jobs purchased an animation company from George Lucas, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. Believing in Pixar's potential, Jobs initially invested $50 million of his own money in the company. The studio went on to produce wildly popular movies such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles; Pixar's films have collectively netted $4 billion. The studio merged with Walt Disney in 2006, making Steve Jobs Disney's largest shareholder. Reinventing Apple Despite Pixar's success, NeXT, Inc. floundered in its attempts to sell its specialized operating system to mainstream America. Apple eventually bought the company in 1996 for $429 million. The following year, Jobs returned to his post as Apple's CEO. Just as Steve Jobs instigated Apple's success in the 1970s, he is credited with revitalizing the company in the 1990s. With a new management team, altered stock options and a self-imposed annual salary of $1 a year, Jobs put Apple back on track. His ingenious products (like the iMac), effective branding campaigns and stylish designs caught the attention of consumers once again. Later Innovations Apple introduced such revolutionary products as the Macbook Air, iPod and iPhone, all of which have dictated the evolution of modern technology. Almost immediately after Apple releases a new product, competitors scramble to produce comparable technologies. Apple's quarterly reports improved significantly in 2007: Stocks were worth $199.99 a share—a record-breaking number at that time—and the company boasted a staggering $1.58 billion profit, an $18 billion surplus in the bank and zero debt. In 2008, iTunes became the second-biggest music retailer in America—second only to Walmart, fueled by iTunes and iPod sales. Apple has also been ranked No. 1 on Fortune magazine's list of "America's Most Admired Companies," as well as No. 1 among Fortune 500 companies for returns to shareholders.

Column chart - how when to use a column chart. Data that’s arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a column chart. A column chart typically displays categories along the horizontal (category) axis and values along the vertical (value) axis Line Charts - how when to use a Line chart. Data that's arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a line chart. In a line chart, category data is distributed evenly along the horizontal axis, and all value data is distributed evenly along the vertical axis. Line charts can show continuous data over time on an evenly scaled axis, so they're ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, like months, quarters, or fiscal years. Pie chart - how when to use a Pie chart. Data that's arranged in one column or row on a worksheet can be plotted in a pie chart. Pie charts show the size of items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole pie. Bar Chart -how when to use a bar chart. Data that's arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a bar chart. Bar charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In a bar chart, the categories are typically organized along the vertical axis, and the values along the horizontal axis. Treemap chart -how when to use a Treemap chart The treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and an easy way to compare different levels of categorization. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity and can easily show lots of data which would be difficult with other chart types. The treemap chart can be plotted when empty (blank) cells exist within the hierarchal structure and treemap charts are good for comparing proportions within the hierarchy. Combo Chart - how when to use a Combo Chart Data that's arranged in columns and rows can be plotted in a combo chart. Combo charts combine two or more chart types to make the data easy to understand, especially when the data is widely varied. Shown with a secondary axis, this chart is even easier to read. In this example, we used a column chart to show the number of homes sold between January and June and then used a line chart to make it easier for readers to quickly identify the average sales price by month. Pareto Chart - how when to use a Pareto Chart A Pareto chart, named after Vilfredo Pareto, is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. Treemap Chart - how when to use a Treemap Chart A treemap chart provides a hierarchical view of your data and makes it easy to spot patterns, such as which items are a store's best sellers. The tree branches are represented by rectangles and each sub-branch is shown as a smaller rectangle. The treemap chart displays categories by color and proximity and can easily show lots of data which would be difficult with other chart types. Treemap charts are good for comparing proportions within the hierarchy, however, treemap charts aren't great at showing hierarchical levels between the largest categories and each data point Sparkline Chart - how when to use a Sparkline Chart a sparkline is a tiny chart in a worksheet cell that provides a visual representation of data. Use sparklines to show trends in a series of values, such as seasonal increases or decreases, economic cycles, or to highlight maximum and minimum values. Position a sparkline near its data for greatest impact.

Step II: After download the zip file - Extract it - Now you will found .ttf file Step III: Now go to Start - Control Panel - Fonts - Paste the font file Step IV: You done all thing now go to MS Word select font from drop down and type in that font. Most applications (such as Microsoft Word, Word, and PowerPoint) include fonts that are automatically installed when you install the software. For example, applications that are created especially for document design projects, such as Microsoft Publisher, often come with quite a few extra fonts that you can use with any other program on your computer. However, sometimes you may want to install custom fonts that you've created, purchased or downloaded from somewhere else. In this article we'll talk about how to install those fonts so you can use them in Microsoft Office. After you find a font that you would like to use with an Office application, you can download it and install it through the operating system that you are currently using on your computer. Because fonts work with the operating system, they are not downloaded to Office directly. You should go through the system's Fonts folder in Windows Control Panel and the font will work with Office automatically. On the Mac you use the Font Book to add the font and then copy it to the Windows Office Compatible folder. Sharing files that contain non-standard fonts When you install a custom font, each font will work only with the computer you've installed it on. Custom fonts that you've installed on your computer might not display the same way on a different computer. Text that is formatted in a font that is not installed on a computer will display in Times New Roman or the default font. Therefore, if you plan to share Microsoft Office Word, PowerPoint, or Word files with other people, you'll want to know which fonts are native to the version of Office that the recipient is using. If it isn't native, you may have to embed or distribute the font along with the Word file, PowerPoint presentation, or Word spreadsheet.

Slide transitions are the animation-like effects that occur when you move from one slide to the next during a presentation. You can control the speed, add sound, and customize the properties of transition effects. Add or change a slide transition In the Thumbnail Pane, click the slide where you want to apply or change a transition. The transition setting dictates how that slide enters and the preceding slide exits – in our example below, if you add a transition to slide 3, it dictates how slide 2 leaves and slide 3 enters. Shows Slide Pane with third slide selected in PowerPoint On the Transitions tab, find the effect that you want in the Transition gallery. Click the More button Button image to see the entire gallery. Click the effect that you want for that slide to select it or to see a preview. Click Effect Options to change how the transition occurs – for example, what direction the slide enters from. Optional: To set how fast the transition goes, enter a time in the Duration box. Set the number higher to make the transition go slower. For more about transition timing, see Set the speed and timing of transitions. To add sound to your transition, select a sound in the Sound box, or select Other Sound to choose a sound from your computer. If you want all slides in the presentation to transition the same way, click Apply To All. Click Preview to see what the transition looks like with all the settings. Remove a transition Remember that a transition applies to a slide’s entrance, not how it exits. So if you want to remove the exit effects for slide 2, remove the transition from slide 3. Click the slide that you want to have no transition. Then on the Transitions tab, in the Transitions gallery, click None. Shows Transitions in the menu in PowerPoint In our example, if slide 3 has no transition, it appears instantly as slide 2 disappears. To remove transitions from all slides, select all the slides in your presentation Ctrl+A) in the Thumbnail pane, and then on the Transitions tab, in the Transitions gallery, click None.

To create a rule by choosing your own conditions, actions, and exceptions, do the following: In the Navigation Pane, click Mail. On the Tools menu, click Rules and Alerts. If you have more than one e-mail account, in the Apply changes to this folder list, select the Inbox that you want. Click New Rule. Under Start from a blank rule, select either Check messages when they arrive or Check messages after sending, and then click Next. Under Step 1: Select condition, select the conditions that you want the messages to meet for the rule to apply. Under Step 2: Edit the rule description, click an underlined value if you have not done so already, and then click Next. Under Step 1: Select action, select the action that you want the rule to take when the specified conditions are met. Under Step 2: Edit the rule description, click an underlined value if you have not done so already, and then click Next. Under Step 1: Select exception, select any exceptions to the rule, and then click Next. To finish creating the rule, enter a name for the rule, and then select any other options that you want. If you want to run this rule on messages that already are in one of your folders, select the Run this rule now on messages already in "folder" check box. To apply this rule to all your e-mail accounts and the Inbox associated with each account, select the Create this rule on all accounts check box. How rules help you manage messages A rule is an action that Microsoft Outlook takes automatically on an arriving or sent message that meets the conditions that you specify in the rule. You can choose many conditions and actions by using the Rules and Alerts Wizard. Rules do not operate on message that have been read, only on those that are unread. Rules fall into one of two general categories: organization and notification. The Rules and Alerts Wizard contains templates for the most commonly used rules. Stay organized These are rules that help you to file and follow up on messages. For example, you can create a rule for messages from a specific sender, such as Bobby Moore, with the word "sales" in the Subject line, to be flagged for follow-up, categorized as Sales, and moved to a folder called Bobby's Sales. Stay up-to-date These are rules that notify you in some way when you receive a particular message. For example, you can create a rule that automatically sends an alert to your mobile telephone when you receive a message from a family member. Click Finish.

For example, look up a price of an automotive part by the part number. =VLOOKUP(Value you want to look up, range where you want to lookup the value, the column number in the range containing the return value, Exact Match or Approximate Match – indicated as 0/FALSE or 1/TRUE). Use the VLOOKUP function to look up a value in a table. Syntax VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]) For example: =VLOOKUP(105,A2:C7,2,TRUE) =VLOOKUP("Fontana",B2:E7,2,FALSE) Argument name Description lookup_value (required) The value you want to look up. The value you want to look up must be in the first column of the range of cells you specify in table-array . For example, if table-array spans cells B2:D7, then your lookup_value must be in column B. See the graphic below. Lookup_value can be a value or a reference to a cell. table_array (required) The range of cells in which the VLOOKUP will search for the lookup_value and the return value. The first column in the cell range must contain the lookup_value (for example, Last Name in the picture below.) The cell range also needs to include the return value (for example, First Name in the graphic below) you want to find. Learn how to select ranges in a worksheet. col_index_num (required) The column number (starting with 1 for the left-most column of table-array) that contains the return value. range_lookup (optional) A logical value that specifies whether you want VLOOKUP to find an approximate or an exact match: TRUE assumes the first column in the table is sorted either numerically or alphabetically, and will then search for the closest value. This is the default method if you don't specify one. FALSE searches for the exact value in the first column. How to get started There are four pieces of information that you will need in order to build the VLOOKUP syntax: The value you want to look up, also called the lookup value. The range where the lookup value is located. Remember that the lookup value should always be in the first column in the range for VLOOKUP to work correctly. For example, if your lookup value is in cell C2 then your range should start with C. The column number in the range that contains the return value. For example, if you specify B2: D11 as the range, you should count B as the first column, C as the second, and so on. Optionally, you can specify TRUE if you want an approximate match or FALSE if you want an exact match of the return value. If you don't specify anything, the default value will always be TRUE or approximate match. Now put all of the above together as follows: =VLOOKUP(lookup value, range containing the lookup value, the column number in the range containing the return value, optionally specify TRUE for approximate match or FALSE for an exact match).

If Formula in Excel 3. Pivot Table in Excel 4. Or Formula in Excel 5. And Formula in Excel 1. Vlookup Formula in Excel Use VLOOKUP, one of the lookup and reference functions, when you need to find things in a table or a range by row. For example, look up a price of an automotive part by the part number. =VLOOKUP(Value you want to look up, range where you want to lookup the value, the column number in the range containing the return value, Exact Match or Approximate Match – indicated as 0/FALSE or 1/TRUE). 2. If Formula in Excel The IF function is one of the most popular functions in Excel, and it allows you to make logical comparisons between a value and what you expect. In its simplest form, the IF function says: IF(Something is True, then do something, otherwise do something else) So an IF statement can have two results. The first result is if your comparison is True, the second if your comparison is False. 3. PivotTable in Excel Being able to analyse all the data in your worksheet can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes it’s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. Excel can help you by recommending and then automatically creating PivotTables, which are a great way to summarize, analyse, explore, and present your data. 4. And Formula in Excel Use the AND function to determine if all conditions in a test are TRUE. 5. Or Formula in Excel Use the OR function to determine if any conditions in a test are TRUE. Use the OR function to test multiple conditions at the same time, up to 255 conditions total.

All That You Need To Know	Data Validation In Excel Everything That You Need To Know. Data validation is a feature available in Microsoft Excel. It allows you to do the following: Data Validation In Excel Make a list of the entries that restricts the values allowed in a cell. Data Validation In Excel Create a prompt message explaining the kind of data allowed in a cell. Data Validation In Excel Create messages that appear when incorrect data has been entered. Data Validation In Excel Check for incorrect entries by using the Auditing toolbar. Data Validation In Excel Set a range of numeric values that can be entered in a cell. Data Validation In Excel Determine if an entry is valid based on calculation in another cell. You use data validation to control the type of data or the values that users enter into a cell. For example, you may want to restrict data entry to a certain range of dates, limit choices by using a list, or make sure that only positive whole numbers are entered. This article describes how data validation works in Excel and outlines the different data validation techniques available to you. It does not cover cell protection, which is a feature that lets you "lock" or hide certain cells in a worksheet so that they can't be edited or overwritten Data validation is an Excel feature that you can use to define restrictions on what data can or should be entered in a cell. You can configure data validation to prevent users from entering data that is not valid. If you prefer, you can allow users to enter invalid data but warn them when they try to type it in the cell. You can also provide messages to define what input you expect for the cell, and instructions to help users correct any errors. Restrict data to predefined items in a list For example, you can limit types of departments to Sales, Finance, R&D, and IT. Similarly, you can create a list of values from a range of cells elsewhere in the worksheet. Restrict numbers outside a specified range For example, you can specify a minimum limit of deductions to two times the number of children in a particular cell. Restrict dates outside a certain time frame For example, you can specify a time frame between today's date and 3 days from today's date. Restrict times outside a certain time frame For example, you can specify a time frame for serving breakfast between the time when the restaurant opens and 5 hours after the restaurant opens. Limit the number of text characters For example, you can limit the allowed text in a cell to 10 or fewer characters. Similarly, you can set the specific length for a full name field (C1) to be the current length of a first name field (A1) and a last name field (B1), plus 10 characters. Validate data based on formulas or values in other cells For example, you can use data validation to set a maximum limit for commissions and bonuses of $3,600, based on the overall projected payroll value. If users enter more than $3,600 in the cell, they see a validation message. Restrict data entry to values in a drop-down list Restrict data entry to a whole number within limits Restrict data entry to a decimal number within limits Restrict data entry to a date within a time frame Restrict data entry to a time within a time frame Restrict data entry to text of a specified length Calculate what is allowed based on the content of another cell Use a formula to calculate what is allowed To watch more videos and download the files visit http://www.myelesson.org To Buy The Full Excel Course visit . http://www.myelesson.org/product or call 9752003788 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT43M46S	2626	2d	hd	false		1	5476	37	3	0	7

VLOOKUP is a function to lookup up and retrieve data in a table. The "V" in VLOOKUP stands for vertical, which means the data in the table must be arranged vertically, with data in rows. VLOOKUP requires that the table be structured so that lookup values appear in the left-most column. The data you want to retrieve (result values) can appear in any column to the right. When you use VLOOKUP, imagine that every column in the table is numbered, starting from the left. To get a value from a particular column, simply supply the appropriate number as the "column index" To use VLOOKUP, you supply 4 pieces of information, or "arguments": The value you are looking for (lookup_value) The range of cells that make up the table (table_array) The number of the column from which to retrieve a result (column_index) The match mode (range_lookup, TRUE = approximate, FALSE = exact) HLOOKUP searches for a value in the first row of a table. At the match column, it retrieves a value from the specified row. Use HLOOKUP when lookup values are located in the first row of a table. ange_lookup controls whether value needs to match exactly or not. The default is TRUE = allow non-exact match. Set range_lookup to FALSE to require an exact match. If range_lookup is TRUE (the default setting), a non-exact match will cause the HLOOKUP function to match the nearest value in the table that is still less than value. When range_lookup is omitted, the HLOOKUP function will allow a non-exact match, but it will use an exact match if one exists. If range_lookup is TRUE (the default setting) make sure that lookup values in the first row of the table are sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, HLOOKUP may return an incorrect or unexpected value. If range_lookup is FALSE (require exact match), values in the first row of table do not need to be sorted.

Charts are used to display series of numeric data in a graphical format to make it easier to understand large quantities of data and the relationship between different series of data. To create a chart in Excel, you start by entering the numeric data for the chart on a worksheet. Then you can plot that data into a chart by selecting the chart type that you want to use on the Office Fluent Ribbon (Insert tab, Charts group). Excel supports many types of charts to help you display data in ways that are meaningful to your audience. When you create a chart or change an existing chart, you can select from a variety of chart types (such as a column chart or a pie chart) and their subtypes (such as a stacked column chart or a pie in 3-D chart). You can also create a combination chart by using more than one chart type in your chart. A chart has many elements. Some of these elements are displayed by default, others can be added as needed. You can change the display of the chart elements by moving them to other locations in the chart, resizing them, or by changing the format. You can also remove chart elements that you do not want to display. 1. The chart area of the chart. 2. The plot area of the chart. 3. The data points of the data series that are plotted in the chart. 4. The horizontal (category) and vertical (value) axis along which the data is plotted in the chart. 5. The legend of the chart. 6. A chart and axis title that you can use in the chart. 7. A data label that you can use to identify the details of a data point in a data series. Modifying a basic chart to meet your needs After you create a chart, you can modify any one of its elements. For example, you might want to change the way that axes are displayed, add a chart title, move or hide the legend, or display additional chart elements. To modify a chart, you can: Change the display of chart axes You can specify the scale of axes and adjust the interval between the values or categories that are displayed. To make your chart easier to read, you can also add tick marks to an axis, and specify the interval at which they will appear. Add titles and data labels to a chart To help clarify the information that appears in your chart, you can add a chart title, axis titles, and data labels. Add a legend or data table You can show or hide a legend, change its location, or modify the legend entries. In some charts, you can also show a data table that displays the legend keys and the values that are presented in the chart. Apply special options for each chart type Special lines (such as high-low lines and trendlines), bars (such as up-down bars and error bars), data markers, and other options are available for different chart types.

Calling a procedure refers to using or executing a procedure. How to a Call Sub procedures in the Same Module You can call sub-procedures either solely by their name or precede the name with the Call keyword. Calling a sub named strGetName which does not receive arguments, which was declared as - Sub strGetName(): strGetName Call strGetName Calling a sub named strGetName which receives arguments, which was declared as - Sub strGetName(firstName As String, secondName As String): Call strGetName(firstName, secondName) strGetName firstName, secondName Note that argument(s) must be enclosed within parentheses when using the Call keyword, and multiple arguments must omit the parentheses when the Call keyword is not used. Calling Procedures in Outside Modules As explained above, Public procedures can be called by all procedures of outside modules. To do so, it is mostly required to specify the module that contains the called procedure. There are different ways to call procedures located in a workbook/ worksheet/ form module, standard module or a class module. Calling Procedures located in a Workbook Module, Worksheet Module or Forms Module If the called procedure is located in a Workbook Module, Worksheet Module or Forms Module, then you will need to specify the module while calling it from an outside module. A sub named strGetName, which was declared as - Sub strGetName() - and located in the workbook module named ThisWorkbook, can be called by specifying - ThisWorkbook.strGetName - in the calling procedure located in an outside module. A sub named strGetName, which was declared as - Sub strGetName() - and located in the worksheet module named Sheet2, can be called by specifying - Sheet2.strGetName - in the calling procedure located in an outside module. A sub named strGetName, which was declared as - Sub strGetName() - and located in the UserForm named UserForm1, can be called by specifying - UserForm1.strGetName - in the calling procedure located in an outside module. Calling Procedures located in Standard Modules Procedures in standard modules can be called from a procedure in an outside module just like you call a procedure located in the same module ie. without specifying the module of the called procedure. A sub named strGetName, which was declared as - Sub strGetName() - and located in a standard module, can be called from a procedure in a worksheet module by using only its name ie. strGetName, or using the Call keyword ie. Call strGetName. You might already be aware that procedures of same name are not allowed within the same module but procedures can have same names in separate modules. If both the standard modules (Module1 and Module2) have a procedure named strGetName, to call it from an outside module (say, from a standard module named Module3), you will need to specify the called procedure's module viz. Module1.strGetName OR Module2.strGetName. However, if the calling procedure is located in Module2 and if you call the procedure named strGetName without specifying the module, then the procedure strGetName located in Module 2 will be called. Calling Procedures located in Class Modules In the calling procedure located in an outside module, you need to instantiate an instance of the class in which the called procedure is located. To do this, you create a variable and definine it as a reference to the class. Use this variable with the name of the called procedure located in the class module. For example, in the calling procedure use the statement - Dim iStudent As New clsStudent - to use a variable named iStudent and create an instance of the class named clsStudent. To call the Grade function located in the clsStudent object, use the variable with the function name - iStudent.Grade. If the Grade function receives an argument, then to call the Grade function - iStudent.Grade (argument).

The condition can be tested either at the start or at the end of the Loop. "The Do While … Loop Statements" test the condition at the start, while "The Do … Loop While Statements" test the condition at the end of the Loop. If the condition is tested at the start of the Loop, the block of code does not execute if the condition is not met initially (and the loop does not run even once) whereas if the condition is tested at the end, the Loop runs atleast once. The Do While … Loop Statements (The condition is tested at the start, in this Loop) Do While [Condition] [block of code] Loop The Do … Loop While Statements (The condition is tested at the end, in this Loop) Do [block of code] Loop While [Condition] The Do Until loop is very similar to the Do While loop. The loop repeatedly executes a section of code until a specified condition evaluates to True. Do While loop, you may on some occasions want to enter the loop at least once, regardless of the initial condition There are 2 ways a Do While loop can be used in Excel VBA Macro code. You can tell Excel to check the condition before entering the loop, or tell Excel to enter the loop and then check the condition. To stop an endless loop, press ESC or CTRL+BREAK. To force an exit from a Do Until loop you use the line: Exit Do, e.g. If lNum = 7 Then Exit Do Looping is one of the most powerful programming techniques.

In this video you will learn how to use Nested For Loop in VBA Hindi. This VBA example shows that you can use Nested For Next Loop to create a multiplication table with vba macro.

Visual Basic evaluates these values only at this time and then assigns startto counter. Before the statement block runs, Visual Basic compares counter to end. If counter is already larger than the end value (or smaller if step is negative), the For loop ends and control passes to the statement that follows the Next statement. Otherwise, the statement block runs. Each time Visual Basic encounters the Next statement, it increments counter by step and returns to the For statement. Again it compares counter toend, and again it either runs the block or exits the loop, depending on the result. This process continues until counter passes end or an Exit Forstatement is encountered. The loop doesn't stop until counter has passed end. If counter is equal to end, the loop continues. . If you change the value of counter while inside a loop, your code might be more difficult to read and debug. Changing the value of start, end, orstep doesn't affect the iteration values that were determined when the loop was first entered. If you nest loops, the compiler signals an error if it encounters the Next statement of an outer nesting level before the Next statement of an inner level. However, the compiler can detect this overlapping error only if you specify counter in every Next statement 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT4M49S	289	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lSsn53XnTyE/maxresdefault.jpg	1	8050	80	1	0	14

By using names, you can make your formulas much easier to understand and maintain. You can define a name for a cell range, function, constant, or table. Once you adopt the practice of using names in your workbook, you can easily update, audit, and manage these names. Types of names There are several types of names that you can create and use. Defined name A name that represents a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value. You can create your own defined name, and Microsoft Office Excel sometimes creates a defined name for you, such as when you set a print area. Table name A name for an Excel table, which is a collection of data about a particular subject that is stored in records (rows) and fields (columns). Excel creates a default Excel table name of Table1, Table2, and so on, each time that you insert an Excel table, but you can change a table's name to make it more meaningful. For more information about Excel tables, see Using structured references with Excel tables. The scope of a name All names have a scope, either to a specific worksheet (also called the local worksheet level) or to the entire workbook (also called the global workbook level). The scope of a name is the location within which the name is recognized without qualification.

In this video I have also elaborated upon the Advanced features offered by the Find and Replace command in excel like replacing with a specific color or font and much more. Use the Find and Replace features in Excel to search for something in your workbook, such as a particular number or text string. In a worksheet, click any cell. On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Find & Select. Excel Ribbon Image Do one of the following: To find text or numbers, click Find. To find and replace text or numbers, click Replace. In the Find what box, type the text or numbers that you want to search for, or click the arrow in the Find what box, and then click a recent search in the list. You can use wildcard characters, such as an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?), in your search criteria: Use the asterisk to find any string of characters. For example, s*d finds "sad" and "started". Use the question mark to find any single character. For example, s?t finds "sat" and "set". TIP: You can find asterisks, question marks, and tilde characters (~) in worksheet data by preceding them with a tilde character in the Find what box. For example, to find data that contains "?", you would type ~? as your search criteria. Click Options to further define your search, and then do any of the following: To search for data in a worksheet or in an entire workbook, in the Within box, select Sheet or Workbook. To search for data in rows or columns, in the Search box, click By Rows or By Columns. To search for data with specific details, in the Look in box, click Formulas, Values, or Comments. Note Formulas, Values and Comments are only available on the Find tab; whereas only Formulas are available on the Replace tab. To search for case-sensitive data, select the Match case check box. To search for cells that contain just the characters that you typed in the Find what box, select the Match entire cell contents check box. If you want to search for text or numbers that also have specific formatting, click Format, and then make your selections in the Find Format dialog box. TIP: If you want to find cells that just match a specific format, you can delete any criteria in the Find what box, and then select a specific cell format as an example. Click the arrow next to Format, click Choose Format From Cell, and then click the cell that has the formatting that you want to search for. Do one of the following: To find text or numbers, click Find All or Find Next. TIP: When you click Find All, every occurrence of the criteria that you are searching for will be listed, and you can make a cell active by clicking a specific occurrence in the list. You can sort the results of a Find All search by clicking a column heading. To replace text or numbers, type the replacement characters in the Replace with box (or leave this box blank to replace the characters with nothing), and then click Find or Find All. NOTE: If the Replace with box is not available, click the Replace tab. If needed, you can cancel a search in progress by pressing ESC. To replace the highlighted occurrence or all occurrences of the found characters, click Replace or Replace All.

Pareto Analysis is a technique used for decision making based on the Pareto Principle, known as the 80/20 rule. It is a decision-making technique that statistically separates a limited number of input factors as having the greatest impact on an outcome, either desirable or undesirable. Pareto analysis is based on the idea that 80% of a project's benefit can be achieved by doing 20% of the work or conversely 80% of problems are traced to 20% of the causes.

Steps to Add a table to a slide in PowerPoint Applies To: PowerPoint 2016 PowerPoint 2013 PowerPoint 2010 PowerPoint 2007 More... If you want to add a table to your PowerPoint presentation, you have options. You can create and format a table within PowerPoint, copy and paste a table from Word, copy and paste a group of cells from Excel, or insert an Excel spreadsheet into your PowerPoint presentation. It isn't possible to convert text on a slide into a table. Insert the table first, then add text to it. Create and format a table in PowerPoint Select the slide that you want to add a table to. On the Insert tab, select Table. Shows the Table option in the Insert tab on the ribbon in PowerPoint In the Insert Table dialog box, do one of the following: Use the mouse to select the number of rows and columns that you want. Select Insert Table, and then enter a number in the Number of columns and Number of rows lists. Shows the Insert Table dialog in PowerPoint NOTE: If you are using PowerPoint Online, you can only insert a table by using the mouse to select the number of rows and columns that you want. To add text to the table cells, click a cell, and then enter your text. After you enter your text, click outside the table. TIPS: To quickly insert a new row at the end of a table, click inside the last cell of the last row, and then press TAB. To add rows or columns, right-click a cell, click Insert on the mini toolbar, and choose where you’d like to insert the row or column. To delete rows or columns, right-click a cell, click Delete on the mini toolbar, and choose what you'd like to delete. Copy and paste a table from Word In Word, click the table that you want to copy, and then go to Layout - Select - Select Table. On the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, select Copy. In your PowerPoint presentation, select the slide that you want to copy the table to, and then on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Paste. TIP: You can also copy and paste a table from your PowerPoint presentation onto an Excel worksheet or into a Word document. Copy and paste a group of cells from Excel To copy a group of cells from an Excel worksheet, click the upper-left cell of the grouping that you want to copy, and then drag to select the rows and columns that you want. On the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, select Copy. In your PowerPoint presentation, select the slide that you want to copy the group of cells to, and then on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Paste. TIP: You can also copy and paste a table from your PowerPoint presentation onto an Excel worksheet or into a Word document. Insert an Excel spreadsheet within PowerPoint NOTE: This can't be done in PowerPoint Online. When you insert an Excel spreadsheet into your presentation, it becomes an OLE embedded object. If you change the theme (colors, fonts, and effects) of your presentation, the theme does not update the spreadsheet you inserted from Excel. You also won't be able to edit the table by using options in PowerPoint. Select the slide that you want to insert an Excel spreadsheet into. Go to Insert - Table, and then choose Excel Spreadsheet. To add text to a table cell, click the cell, and then enter your text. After you enter your text, click outside the table. TIP: To edit the Excel spreadsheet after you have deselected it, double-click the table.

Description of Dollar Formula The function described in this Help topic converts a number to text format and applies a currency symbol. The name of the function (and the symbol that it applies) depends upon your language settings. This function converts a number to text using currency format, with the decimals rounded to the specified place. The format used is $#,##0.00_);($#,##0.00). How to use Dollar Formula DOLLAR(number, [decimals]) The DOLLAR function syntax has the following arguments: Number Required.

A number formatted with the Format Cells dialog box is still a number. You can continue to use the results generated by DOLLAR in other formulas, because Excel converts numbers entered as text to numbers when it calculates.

Clean Formula in Excel Removes all nonprintable characters from text. Use CLEAN formula on text imported from other applications that contains characters that may not print with your operating system. For example, you can use CLEAN formula to remove some low-level computer code that is frequently at the beginning and end of data files and cannot be printed. IMPORTANT: The CLEAN formula was designed to remove the first 32 nonprinting characters in the 7-bit ASCII code (values 0 through 31) from text. In the Unicode character set, there are additional nonprinting characters (values 127, 129, 141, 143, 144, and 157). By itself, the CLEAN formula function does not remove these additional nonprinting characters. For an example of how to remove these additional nonprinting characters from text, see Remove spaces and nonprinting characters from text. Process on How to use Clean Formula CLEAN(text) The CLEAN formula syntax has the following arguments: Text Required. Any worksheet information from which you want to remove nonprintable characters.

Use Sort in Excel when You might want to put a list of names in alphabetical order, compile a list of product inventory levels from highest to lowest, or order rows by colors or icons. Sorting data helps you quickly visualize and understand your data better, organize and find the data that you want, and ultimately make more effective decisions. See how to Sort in Excel based on 1) Sort in Excel based on Number 2) Sort in Excel based on Dates 3) Sort in Excel based on Alphabets 4) Sort in Excel based on Colors You can sort data by text (A to Z or Z to A), numbers (smallest to largest or largest to smallest), and dates and times (oldest to newest and newest to oldest) in one or more columns. You can also sort by a custom list (such as Large, Medium, and Small) or by format, including cell color, font color, or icon set. Most sort operations are column sorts, but you can also sort by rows. Sort criteria are saved with the workbook so that you can reapply the sort each time that you open the workbook for an Excel table, but not for a range of cells. If you want to save sort criteria so that you can periodically reapply a sort when you open a workbook, then it's a good idea to use a table. This is especially important for multicolumn sorts or for sorts that take a long time to create. When you reapply a sort, different results appear for the following reasons: Data has been added, modified, or deleted to the range of cells or table column. Values returned by a formula have changed and the worksheet has been recalculated.

A Pivot Table report is especially useful when you have a long list of figures to sum, and aggregated data or subtotals would help you look at the data from different perspectives and compare figures of similar data. Create a Pivot Table to analyze worksheet data Being able to quickly analyze data can help you make better business decisions. But sometimes it’s hard to know where to start, especially when you have a lot of data. Pivot Tables are a great way to summarize, analyze, explore, and present your data, and you can create them with just a few clicks. Pivot Tables are highly flexible and can be quickly adjusted depending on how you need to display your results. You can also create Pivot Charts based on Pivot Tables that will automatically update when your Pivot Tables do. Tips to make Pivot Tables in Excel Hindi You data should be organized in a tabular format, and not have any blank rows or columns. Ideally, you can use an Excel table like in our example above. Tables are a great Pivot Table data source, because rows added to a table are automatically included in the Pivot Table when you refresh the data, and any new columns will be included in the Pivot Table Fields List. Otherwise, you need to either manually update the data source range, or use a dynamic named range formula. Data types in columns should be the same. For example, you shouldn't mix dates and text in the same column. Pivot Tables work on a snapshot of your data, called the cache, so your actual data doesn't get altered in any way. 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT8M51S	531	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1E6aiVgH9Q/maxresdefault.jpg	1	109407	373	22	0	92

The COUNTIFS formula applies criteria to cells across multiple ranges and counts the number of times all criteria are met. The COUNTIFS function syntax has the following arguments: criteria_range1 Required. The first range in which to evaluate the associated criteria. criteria1 Required. The criteria in the form of a number, expression, cell reference, or text that define which cells will be counted. For example, criteria can be expressed as 32, B4, "apples", or "32". criteria_range2, criteria2, ... Optional. Additional ranges and their associated criteria. Up to 127 range/criteria pairs are allowed. Each range's criteria is applied one cell at a time. If all of the first cells meet their associated criteria, the count increases by 1. If all of the second cells meet their associated criteria, the count increases by 1 again, and so on until all of the cells are evaluated. If the criteria argument is a reference to an empty cell, the COUNTIFS formula treats the empty cell as a 0 value.

The AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel syntax has the following arguments: Average_range Required. One or more cells to average, including numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers. Criteria_range1, criteria_range2, … Criteria_range1 is required, subsequent criteria_ranges are optional. 1 to 127 ranges in which to evaluate the associated criteria. Criteria1, criteria2, ... Criteria1 is required, subsequent criteria are optional. 1 to 127 criteria in the form of a number, expression, cell reference, or text that define which cells will be averaged. For example, criteria can be expressed as 32, "32", "apples", or B4. Remarks for AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel If average_range is a blank or text value, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV0! error value in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel If a cell in a criteria range is empty, AVERAGEIFS treats it as a 0 value in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. Cells in range that contain TRUE evaluate as 1; cells in range that contain FALSE evaluate as 0 in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. Each cell in average_range is used in the average calculation only if all of the corresponding criteria specified are true for that cell in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. Unlike the range and criteria arguments in the AVERAGEIF function, in AVERAGEIFS each criteria_range must be the same size and shape as sum_range in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. If cells in average_range cannot be translated into numbers, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV0! error value in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. If there are no cells that meet all the criteria, AVERAGEIFS returns the #DIV/0! error value in AVERAGEIFS formula in Excel. You can use the wildcard characters, question mark and asterisk in criteria. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters.

You use the SUMIF function to sum the values in a range that meet criteria that you specify. For example, suppose that in a column that contains numbers, you want to sum only the values that are larger than 5. The SUMIF formula returns incorrect results when you use it to match strings longer than 255 characters or to the string #VALUE! The SUMIF function sums cells that satisfy a single condition that you supply. It takes 3 arguments, range, criteria, and sum range. Note that sum_range is optional. If you don't supply sum range, SUMIF will sum the cells in range instead. For example, if I want to sum the cells in this range that contain the number 15, I enter B7:B12 for the range, and 15 for the criteria. There's no need to enter a sum_range since we're summing the same cells used in the condition. Excel then returns 30, two cells in the range contain 15. If I temporarily enter another 15, that result will change. You can add logical operators to the criteria. You can easily move the criteria out onto the worksheet so that it's easier to change. sumif formula in excel 2007 in hindi,sumif in hindi,sumif in excel in hindi,sumif function in excel in hindi,excel sumif in hindi,sumif formula in hindi,sum if in hindi,sumif hindi,sumifs function in excel 2007 in hindi,sumif formula in excel in hindi,sumif function in hindi,sumif excel in hindi,sum if hindi,use of sumif in excel in hindi,sumif excel hindi,excel made easy in hindi,sumif tutorial in hindi,how to use sumif in excel in hindi,sumif in excel hindi,excel sumif formula in hindi,excel sumif hindi,sumifs in hindi,sumif function in excel 2007 in hindi,sum if function in hindi 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT10M5S	605	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Exxah9YHu7g/maxresdefault.jpg	1	28731	152	5	0	18

The SUMIF function sums cells that satisfy a single condition that you supply. It takes 3 arguments, range, criteria, and sum range. Note that sum_range is optional. If you don't supply sum range, SUMIF will sum the cells in range instead. For example, if I want to sum the cells in this range that contain the number 15, I enter B7:B12 for the range, and 15 for the criteria. There's no need to enter a sum_range since we're summing the same cells used in the condition. Excel then returns 30, two cells in the range contain 15. If I temporarily enter another 15, that result will change. You can add logical operators to the criteria. You can easily move the criteria out onto the worksheet so that it's easier to change. 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT9M2S	542	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wdAlxva4qdA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3502	9	2	0	0

DGET is better than VLOOKUP. How to use Dget formula in Excel DGET(database, field, criteria) The DGET function syntax has the following arguments: Database Required. The range of cells that makes up the list or database. A database is a list of related data in which rows of related information are records, and columns of data are fields. The first row of the list contains labels for each column. Field Required. Indicates which column is used in the function. Enter the column label enclosed between double quotation marks, such as "Age" or "Yield," or a number (without quotation marks) that represents the position of the column within the list: 1 for the first column, 2 for the second column, and so on. Criteria Required. The range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify. You can use any range for the criteria argument, as long as it includes at least one column label and at least one cell below the column label in which you specify a condition for the column. Remarks If no record matches the criteria, DGET returns the #VALUE! error value. If more than one record matches the criteria, DGET returns the #NUM! error value. You can use any range for the criteria argument, as long as it includes at least one column label and at least one cell below the column label for specifying the condition. For example, if the range G1:G2 contains the column label Income in G1 and the amount $10,000 in G2, you could define the range as MatchIncome and use that name as the criteria argument in the database functions. Although the criteria range can be located anywhere on the worksheet, do not place the criteria range below the list.

The cells in a range can be adjacent or nonadjacent.) of cells, and then return a value from any cell on the same row of the range. The VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL function syntax has the following arguments (argument: A value that provides information to an action, an event, a method, a property, a function, or a procedure.): lookup_value Required. The value to search in the first column of the table or range. The lookup_value argument can be a value or a reference. If the value you supply for the lookup_value argument is smaller than the smallest value in the first column of the table_array argument, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL returns the #N/A error value. table_array Required. The range of cells that contains the data. You can use a reference to a range (for example, A2:D8), or a range name. The values in the first column of table_array are the values searched by lookup_value. These values can be text, numbers, or logical values. Uppercase and lowercase text are equivalent. col_index_num Required. The column number in the table_array argument from which the matching value must be returned. A col_index_num argument of 1 returns the value in the first column in table_array; a col_index_num of 2 returns the value in the second column in table_array, and so on. If the col_index_num argument is: Less than 1, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL returns the #VALUE! error value. Greater than the number of columns in table_array, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL returns the #REF! error value. range_lookup Optional. A logical value that specifies whether you want VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL to find an exact match or an approximate match: If range_lookup is either TRUE or is omitted, an exact or approximate match is returned. If an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned. Important If range_lookup is either TRUE or is omitted, the values in the first column of table_array must be placed in ascending sort order; otherwise, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL might not return the correct value. For more information, see Sort data in a range or table. If range_lookup is FALSE, the values in the first column of table_array do not need to be sorted. If the range_lookup argument is FALSE, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL will find only an exact match. If there are two or more values in the first column of table_array that match the lookup_value, the first value found is used. If an exact match is not found, the error value #N/A is returned. Remarks When searching text values in the first column of table_array, ensure that the data in the first column of table_array does not contain leading spaces, trailing spaces, inconsistent use of straight ( ' or "" ) and curly ( ' or ") quotation marks, or nonprinting characters. In these cases, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL might return an incorrect or unexpected value. For more information, see CLEAN function and TRIM function. When searching number or date values, ensure that the data in the first column of table_array is not stored as text values. In this case, VLOOKUP FORMULA IN EXCEL might return an incorrect or unexpected value. If range_lookup is FALSE and lookup_value is text, you can use the wildcard characters — the question mark (?) and asterisk (*) — in lookup_value. A question mark matches any single character; an asterisk matches any sequence of characters. If you want to find an actual question mark or asterisk, type a tilde (~) preceding the character." 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT6M10S	370	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H4tyOUiTzVg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	249179	1316	53	0	215

Using Excel, you can create a bar chart and give it a brand-new, appealing look. Much like a column chart, a bar chart in Excel is useful for comparing data points in one or more data series. After you create a bar chart, you can change the spacing between the bars. You can also use a bar chart type to simulate a Gantt chart, a horizontal bar chart that is often used in project management programs. Bar charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In bar charts, categories are organized along the vertical axis and values along the horizontal axis. Consider using a bar chart when: You have one or more data series that you want to plot. Your data contains positive, negative, and zero (0) values. You want to compare the data for numerous categories. The axis labels are long. The values that are shown are durations. When you create a bar chart, you can choose one of the following bar chart subtypes: Clustered bar and clustered bar in 3-D Clustered bar charts compare values across categories. In a clustered bar chart, the categories are typically organized along the vertical axis, and the values along the horizontal axis. A clustered bar in 3-D chart displays the horizontal rectangles in 3-D format; it does not display the data on three axes. Clustered bar and clustered bar charts in 3-D Stacked bar and stacked bar in 3-D Stacked bar charts show the relationship of individual items to the whole. A stacked bar in 3-D chart displays the horizontal rectangles in 3-D format; it does not display the data on three axes. Stacked bar and stacked bar charts in 3-D 100% stacked bar and 100% stacked bar in 3-D This type of chart compares the percentage that each value contributes to a total across categories. A 100% stacked bar in 3-D chart displays the horizontal rectangles in 3-D format; it does not display the data on three axes. 100% stacked column and 100% column charts in 3-D Horizontal cylinder, cone, and pyramid These charts are available in the same clustered, stacked, and 100% stacked chart types that are provided for rectangular bar charts. They show and compare data exactly the same way. The only difference is that these chart types display cylinder, cone, and pyramid shapes instead of horizontal rectangles This is the easiest way to learn how to make great looking Bar charts in Excel .

The number format does not affect the cell value that Excel uses to perform calculations. The actual value is displayed in the formula bar. Excel provides several built-in number formats. You can use these built-in formats as is, or you can use them as a basis for creating your own custom number formats. When you create custom number formats, you can specify up to four sections of format code. Create and apply a custom number format.

Using Excel, you can create a column chart and give it a brand new, appealing look. As one of the most common chart types, a column chart is useful to compare data points in one or more data series. After you create a column chart, you can change the spacing between the columns. You can also create a floating column chart by hiding a data series in the chart. Data that is arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a column chart. Column charts are useful for showing data changes over a period of time or for illustrating comparisons among items. In column charts, categories are typically organized along the horizontal axis and values along the vertical axis. Consider using a column chart when: You have one or more data series that you want to plot. Your data contains positive, negative, and zero (0) values. You want to compare the data for numerous categories side by side. When you create a column chart, you can choose one of the following column chart subtypes: Clustered column and clustered column in 3-D Clustered column charts compare values across categories. A clustered column chart displays values in 2-D vertical rectangles. A clustered column in 3-D chart displays the data by using a 3-D perspective only. A third value axis (depth axis) is not used. Clustered column chart and clustered column chart in 3-D You can use a clustered column chart type when you have categories that represent: Ranges of values (for example, item counts). Specific scale arrangements (for example, a Likert scale with entries, such as strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree). Names that are not in any specific order (for example, item names, geographic names, or the names of people). NOTE: To present data in a 3-D format that uses three axes (a horizontal axis, a vertical axis, and a depth axis) that you can modify, use a 3-D column chart subtype instead. Stacked column and stacked column in 3-D Stacked column charts show the relationship of individual items to the whole, comparing the contribution of each value to a total across categories. A stacked column chart displays values in 2-D vertical stacked rectangles. A 3-D stacked column chart displays the data by using a 3-D perspective only. A third value axis (depth axis) is not used. Stacked column chart and stacked column chart in 3-D You can use a stacked column chart when you have multiple data series and when you want to emphasize the total. 100% stacked column and 100% stacked column in 3-D 100% stacked column charts and 100% stacked column in 3-D charts compare the percentage that each value contributes to a total across categories. A 100% stacked column chart displays values in 2-D vertical 100% stacked rectangles. A 3-D 100% stacked column chart displays the data by using a 3-D perspective only. A third value axis (depth axis) is not used. 100% stacked column chart and 100% column chart in 3-D You can use a 100% stacked column chart when you have three or more data series and you want to emphasize the contributions to the whole, especially if the total is the same for each category. 3-D column 3-D column charts use three axes that you can modify (a horizontal axis, a vertical axis, and a depth axis), and they compare data points along the horizontal and the depth axes. 3-D column chart You can use a 3-D column chart when you want to compare data across the categories and across the series equally, because this chart type shows categories along both the horizontal axis and the depth axis, while the vertical axis displays the values. Cylinder, cone, and pyramid Cylinder, cone, and pyramid charts are available in the same clustered, stacked, 100% stacked, and 3-D chart types that are provided for rectangular column charts, and they show and compare data exactly the same way. The only difference is that these chart types display cylinder, cone, and pyramid shapes instead of rectangles.The columns chart is great way to represent data like target/achieved, etc in the most visually oriented manner. http://www.myelesson.org	27	Education	PT7M22S	442	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R278Uieo2ss/maxresdefault.jpg	1	98058	674	35	0	43

The COUNTA formula in excel counts the number of cells that are not empty in a range. The COUNTA formula syntax has the following arguments: value1 Required. The first argument representing the values that you want to count. value2, ... Optional. Additional arguments representing the values that you want to count, up to a maximum of 255 arguments. The COUNTA formula counts cells containing any type of information, including error values and empty text (""). For example, if the range contains a formula that returns an empty string, the COUNTA Formula counts that value. The COUNTA Formula does not count empty cells. If you do not need to count logical values, text, or error values (in other words, if you want to count only cells that contain numbers), use the COUNT function. If you want to count only cells that meet certain criteria, use the COUNTIF function or the COUNTIFS function. Do visit our website https://www.myelesson.org to download the training workbook.

By restricting values, you ensure that your worksheet entries are valid and that calculations based on them thereby are valid as well. During data entry, a validation list forces anyone using your worksheet to select a value from a drop-down menu rather than typing it and potentially typing the wrong information. In this way, validation lists save time and reduce errors. You can use data entry rules to ensure that data entered has the correct format, and you can restrict the data entered to whole numbers, decimals, dates, times, or a specific text length. You can also specify whether the values need to be between, not between, equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to the values you specify. 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT9M27S	567	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ6sami1Aeg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	12927	59	1	0	11

The Excel Guru shows how to calculate Average in Excel in Hindi by 2 methods 1)Through Formula =average() 2) Through the Fx Function in the Formula Tab. Calculate the average of a group of numbers Let's say you want to find the average number of days to complete a milestone in a project or the average temperature on a particular day over a 10-year time span. There are several ways to calculate the average of a group of numbers. The AVERAGE function measures central tendency, which is the location of the center of a group of numbers in a statistical distribution. The three most common measures of central tendency are: Average which is the arithmetic mean, and is calculated by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers. For example, the average of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 30 divided by 6, which is 5. Median which is the middle number of a group of numbers; that is, half the numbers have values that are greater than the median, and half the numbers have values that are less than the median. For example, the median of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 4. Mode which is the most frequently occurring number in a group of numbers. For example, the mode of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 3. For a symmetrical distribution of a group of numbers, these three measures of central tendency are all the same. For a skewed distribution of a group of numbers, they can be different. What do you want to do? Calculate the average of numbers in a contiguous row or column Calculate the average of numbers not in a contiguous row or column Function details Calculate a weighted average Function details Calculate the average of numbers, ignoring zero (0) values 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU Download free worksheets of the file used in the video from http://www.myelesson.org 10 Most Used Formulas MS Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyMj8HEBNAk Learn Basic Excel Skills For Beginners || Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNEv3s8TuA 10 Most Used Excel Formula https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3FDi98GBk **Most Imporant Excel Formuls Tutorials** Learn Vlookup Formula For Beginners in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vomClevScJQ 5 Excel Questions Asked in Job Interviews https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iwx4AMdij8 Create Speedometer Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6c93-fQlCs Learn the Basic of Excel for Beginners || Part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMSV9T1PoI Create Pareto Chart In Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UdajrDMjRE How to Create Dashboard in Excel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM8T1eYBjQY Excel Interview Questions & Answers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjv1If63nGU	27	Education	PT9M	540	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1zybkFnUCc/maxresdefault.jpg	1	193936	788	51	0	59
