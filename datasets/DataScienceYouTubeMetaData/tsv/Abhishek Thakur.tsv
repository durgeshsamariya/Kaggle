Bio: Valdimir is Sr. Computer Vision Engineer at Lyft, Ph.D. Physics, Veteran of The Russian Airborne Forces, Kaggle Grandmaster Vladimir got his Ph.D. in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at UC Davis. After graduation he was developing Energy Disaggregation algorithms that were a combination of the signal processing and machine learning techniques, working as a data scientist at Bidgely. After this, he moved to San Francisco to work in TrueAccord where he was mainly focussed on building recommender systems. Currently, Vladimir is applying Deep Learning techniques to the computer vision problems at the Lyft's Level5 Engineering Centre that is focussed on the development of the self-driving cars. #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #MaskDetection ------ Please subscribe and like the video to help me keep motivated to make awesome videos like this one. :) To buy my book, Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning problem, please visit: https://bit.ly/buyaaml Follow me on: Twitter: https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi1thakur/ Kaggle: https://kaggle.com/abhishek Instagram: https://instagram.com/abhi4ml	27	Education	PT1H9M47S	587	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAg8pMJRbgA/maxresdefault.jpg		2903	203	3	0	14

Abstract: #DeepLearning has set up new benchmarks for Computer Vision, NLP, Speech, Reinforcement Learning in the past few years. However tabular data competitions are still dominated by gradient boosted trees (GBTs) libraries like XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost. Tabnet is a new promising deep learning architecture based on sequential attention transformers proposed by Arik & Pfister that aims to fill the gap between GBTs and neural networks. Pytorch-tabnet is an open source library that provides a scikit-like interface for training a TabNetClassifier or TabNetRegressor. It's ease of use allow any developer to quickly try a #TabNet architecture on any dataset, hopefully setting up new benchmarks.

Melanoma is skin cancer which is very deadly but can be prevented if we can do early detection. Models like these might be useful to medical community. I am using PyTorch with a "twist". The twist helps us to create highly customizable models quite fast!

This where text is used as both an input and an output for solving all types of tasks. I believe that the combination of text-to-text as a universal format for NLP tasks paired with multi-task learning (single model learning multiple tasks) will have a huge impact on how NLP deep learning is applied in practice. In this presentation I aim to give a brief overview of #T5, explain some of its implications for NLP in industry, and demonstrate how it can be used for sentiment span extraction on tweets. Speaker Bio: Lorenzo Ampil is a Machine Learning Product Manager and Data Scientist at Thinking Machines, a global AI consulting firm w/ operations in Singapore and Manila. He specializes in developing products that utilize deep learning and machine learning on NLP for various industries. Prior to this, he set up his own consulting practice where he provided end-to-end data science solutions for finance and tech companies in Southeast Asia and Australia. He also previously worked at Uber as an analyst, where he handled projects related to NLP, analytics, and automation for the APAC region’s community operations. ------ If you want to be a speaker and talk about your #MachineLearning #DeepLearning Projects, then please fill out this form: https://bit.ly/AbhishekTalks Follow me on: Twitter: https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi1thakur/ Kaggle: https://kaggle.com/abhishek	27	Education	PT1H1M21S	81	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LYw_UIdd4A/maxresdefault.jpg		3104	172	0	0	25

This is a multi-label classification challenge with over 200K images. I will be using PyTorch to solve this problem. By the end of this tutorial you will be able to train any pre-trained model you want to train on this dataset! Competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19 The video is in two parts. In this part, we will build the framework for training any pretrained model we want to train, add augmentations, write the training script and the models and build the final inference.

Kaggle recently incorporated v3-8 TPUs in their Kernels/Notebooks and I will be using those.

There are many new competitions on kaggle now-a-days that require you to submit an inference kernel and it becomes very messy as competitions progress and team grows. It is, therefore, a good idea to keep the code clean and readable (also applies to real world) Follow me on: Twitter: twitter.com/abhi1thakur LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/abhi1thakur/ Kaggle: kaggle.com/abhishek	27	Education	PT28M42S	1722	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C7Tsfrq_g18/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3330	101	0	0	9

In this episode, we talk about the need for #cross #validation and different types of cross-validation. We also see how one can implement a re-usable cross validation framework. In the end we are left with a cross validation framework that can be applied to almost all kinds of machine learning problem.

In this video, I talk about the motivation for this channel and then show how you can create a re-usable machine learning framework for simple tabular datasets. Due to the size of the video, I split them into 2 sub-episodes: Episode 1.1 consists of motivation, setting up a web based IDE, creating an empty framework and creating model training Episode 1.2 shows how the trained model can be used for inference. The whole idea behind this episode is to create code which is re-usable, looks good and can be applied to many different kinds of problem without changing a lot of code.
