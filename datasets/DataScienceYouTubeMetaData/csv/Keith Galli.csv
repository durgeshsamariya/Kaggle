We look at why we use neural networks and how they function. We do an overview of network architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer). We talk a bit about how you choose how many hidden layers and neurons to have. We also look at hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, optimizers (adam), activation functions (relu, sigmoid, softmax), and dropout. We finish the first section of the video talking a little about the differences between keras, tensorflow, & pytorch. Next, we jump into some coding examples to classify data with neural nets. In this section we load in data, do some processing, build our network, fit our data to it, and then finally evaluate our model. The examples get more complex as we go along. Some setup instructions for the coding portion of the video are found below. To install Tensorflow, download Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ Data & code used in tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/neural-nets I’m going to post a follow up video to this soon where we walk through a real world example where we automatically classify images of hands for the game of rock, paper, scissors.

In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data: - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? - What city sold the most product? - What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying product? - What products are most often sold together? - What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most? To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include: - Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat) - Adding columns - Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str) - Using the .apply() method - Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis - Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results - Labeling our graphs If you enjoy this video, make sure to leave it a like and subscribe to not miss any future similar tutorials :). --------------------------------------------- Follow me on social media!

(Recursion & Artwork),"In this video, we code up some more tree animations using python to support the #TeamTrees movement! Link to donate: https://teamtrees.org/ We start off showing how you can use recursion to make basic tree like structures. We then build on that and use more sophisticated recursive logic to make the trees look pretty realistic. Next we go through how you can draw paintings in Python. This method works by sampling points in a photograph and drawing brush strokes of the same color in the generated image. It ultimately outputs some pretty cool stuff :).

I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long. In this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart.

(Connect 4, Othello, Chess, Checkers) - Minimax Algorithm Explained","In this video I build up the intuition for how an expert level board game AI works. We start with a very simple approach of making random moves and then progress to building board scoring heuristics and then finally to the minimax algorithm. I will try to make a video on how to actually program this type of AI in python within the next few weeks. Make sure to subscribe to not miss that! As a bit of background, the minimax algorithm was the same basic algorithm used in IBM Deep Blue that defeated Chess Grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997.

Lists are a mutable structure. This means that you can dynamically change the size and contents of the list. We have several different functions to do this. I cover in this video append, pop, remove, insert, and a few others. Tuples, on the other hand, are an immutable data type. This means that once you create a tuple object, that tuple object and those values inside do not change. When you make changes to a tuple you'll actually be creating a new tuple. Indexing works the same in lists and tuples. Leave a comment and let me know how python is going for you guys and girls!
