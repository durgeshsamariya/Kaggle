This, according to many experts, would have a far-reaching impact on the job market. Looking at the progression of language models, a few years from now, and with further improvements, many more jobs may find themselves in jeopardy. If the trend continues, analysts are saying that AI software will be able to automate white-collar jobs far before robotics catches up to blue-collar jobs. This is because the innovation in AI models is happening faster than advancements in robotics. This is contrary to previous estimations that blue-collar job workers must learn to code because their jobs will be automated.

In the modern world, data is worth more than gold if meaningful insights are successfully extracted from it. There have been multiple studies that focus on extracting insights from this huge pile of data but none of them provides a satisfactory impact analysis. Impact analysis works like our traditional approach to calculate impact based on social proofing. Our model is capable of processing huge amounts of data from multiple sources like tweets, websites, documents etc., and provides deep insights by identifying the context of the data which has been provided to it. The solution works over Bidirectional Encoder Representations (BERT) which is a neural network-based technique for Natural Language Processing (NLP) pre-training. Initially, the solution is provided with multiple links to the articles which may contain information related to the event over which impact analysis is to be performed. The links can be of multiple sorts like Blogs, News articles, Twitter channels, Hashtags, etc. The solution will go through each individual link and process it based on the type of the link. The more relevant the data sources are, the more relevant would be the end analysis after analyzing all individual resources. We tested our model on ‚ÄúUS CHINA TRADE WAR‚Äù and used multiple data sources to let the model extract useful insights like ‚Äì 1.)

Qualitative market research can be valuable when you are developing new marketing initiatives and you want to test reactions on the crowd and refine your approach. One of the powerful qualitative research methodologies is focus group discussion, in which a moderator assembles a group of individuals to discuss a specific topic, aiming to draw conclusions from complex personal experiences, beliefs, perceptions, opinions and attitudes of the participants through a moderated interaction. Focus group interviews are extensively leveraged in sectors like CPR and health- care. Focus Group discussion aids the Consumer Product and Retail sector (CPR) to learn the market pulse and develop better marketing strategies to resonate with the customers and boost the sales. An extensive range of topics central to health and illness has been studied using focus groups including the experience of specific disorders and diseases, violence and abuse, health care practices and procedures, health-related behaviours, and broader factors that mediate health and illness. Focus group discussions are conducted by moderators who keep the group ‚Äúfocused‚Äù and generate a lively and in-depth productive discussion to obtain a balanced input from a diverse group of people. The moderators should take notes of the discussion, analyse the opinions & expressions of participants and arrive at conclusions based on the observations. A biased opinion of the moderator could tamper the business as well as the relationship with the customers. In this paper, we devise a methodology to automate the role of the moderator in the Focus group discussions using Artificial intelligence. The proposed solution uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning to process the video and audio streams of a Focus Group recording to emulate the moderator's role. It summarizes the discussion with the facial expressions and tonality of participants being analysed and co-processed with the participant's positive and negative sentiments on the topics discussed. This implementation helps in reducing the manual effort put in by the moderator and the cost incurred in conducting the discussions. The solution would also eliminate any human bias by the moderator to arrive at an unbiased conclusion. This solution incorporates Neural networks, Machine Learning & Computer vision modules to perform facial emotion detection, sentiment analysis, tonality analysis and topic modelling.

This has led to a proportional growth for the e-commerce logistics (e-logistics) supply chain in the country. With this exponential growth, India is strategically positioned very nicely to solve for some of the most challenging problems facing the logistics industry, test the products in one of the toughest markets and take these solutions to the world. As one of the largest players in the e-logistics space, the depth and breadth of data produced in the network is huge. For e.g. over 50 million geo-codes are produced daily, along with additional information tagged to each geo-code; across first mile, mid mile / line haul and last mile legs of the network. Considering our work on the last mile allocation problem for more than 20,000 people across rural and urban India delivering anywhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000+ shipments daily, this paper discusses key tenets and levers of building an AI platform from scratch and specific challenges that are unique to AI products. ‚ÄúLast Mile‚Äù leg of the e-logistics supply chain in India contributes to about 30% of the entire delivery cost of a shipment and is a tough problem to solve, primarily because of variable demand and poor localization of customer addresses. Typical last-mile delivery model of an e-logistics company includes segregating geographic routes of a last mile center (serviceability) and one or more delivery executive/subcontractor assigned to these routes for deliveries. To achieve better unit economics or generate higher flexible capacity, some of these routes are also subcontracted to local ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù stores, since they can cross utilize their staff for doing local deliveries. However, the capacity of both local stores and delivery executives is limited and there is a cost and reliability difference between the two. Hence, to minimize the cost of last-mile deliveries and maintain appropriate service levels, an e-logistics company must determine an optimal allocation of shipments to their fixed fleet and to the sub-contractors. Other factors to system driven allocation include ensuring fairness and equal opportunity, utilizing local ground intelligence, complexity of delivering a shipment etc. Rishit Jain is working as a Product Manager(Strategy) with the Data Sciences and Artificial Intelligence team at Delhivery, India‚Äôs largest ecommerce logistics provider. His charter includes building an AI driven logistics platform to help Delhivery‚Äôs ground operations be highly efficient and optimized, with the immediate focus on last-mile operations.

Comparing the proposed method's accuracy with basic memory-based techniques and latent factor model. Making accurate predictions for unknown ratings in sparse matrices based on the proposed method. More users are satisfied of the group recommender system's performance. Memory-based collaborating filtering techniques are widely used in recommender systems. They are based on full initial ratings in a user-item matrix. However, most of the time in group recommender systems, this matrix is sparse and users' preferences are unknown. Recommendation systems are widely used in conjunction with many popular personalized services, which enables people to find not only content items they are currently interested in, but also those in which they might become interested. Many recommendation systems employ the memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which has been generally accepted as one of consensus approaches. Despite the usefulness of the CF method for successful recommendation, several limitations remain, such as sparsity and cold-start problems that degrade the performance of CF systems in practice. To overcome these limitations, a content-metadata-based approach is suitable that uses content-metadata in an effective way. By complementarily combining content-metadata with conventional user-content ratings and trust network information, the approach remarkably increases the amount of suggested content and accurately recommends a large number of additional content items.

This is leading to numerous wind power plants being set up all over the world. These power plants rely on the available wind energy for power generation. To harness all the possible energy from the wind, the rotor needs to be perpendicularly aligned with respect to the direction in which the wind is blowing. This is done through a control system called Yaw mechanism. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error, if the rotor is not perpendicular to the wind. The share of energy that can be harnessed from the wind, drops at the rate of cosine of the yaw error. Thus, the correction of yaw errors is necessary to ensure lowered losses and optimized generation. The usual detection techniques include intuitive guesses made by expert site engineers working at the wind farm and through observation of generation patterns. These techniques are at their best, approximations of the actual scenario and only detectable when there are really large yaw errors. The delay in detection in these manual methods amounts to approximately 12% of loss in energy generation. This paper explains how machine learning is being used to detect yaw error right after its onset, identify the root cause and quantify the consequent energy lost. The detection of yaw misalignment is done by analyzing the wind direction, nacelle position and yaw angle data captured by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system installed at the wind power plant. This analysis is then augmented with statistical tests to rule out errors in measurement and ascertain that the data is indeed indicating yaw misalignment. When the results prove to be statistically significant, the next step is to identify the root cause for the misalignment, so that an appropriate corrective action can be recommended to the site engineers. The probable root causes are presence of a faulty sensor, wrongly calibrated sensor or low yaw speed. These root causes are identified through pattern recognition algorithms, that look for different signatures, that each one leaves in the data. A non-linear regression model is then trained to learn the pattern of energy generation of a turbine in healthy condition. This model is then used to predict the energy generation of the turbine for which yaw misalignment has been observed. The difference in the actual and predicted values is the estimate of loss in power generation due to yaw misalignment. The adoption of this algorithm has helped in early identification of yaw errors and take corrective actions in near real time, thus preventing the loss in energy generation of up to 7-9% annually.

The estimated impact of predicting these events and addressing the leakages can be in the range of millions, to even billions of dollars. Machine learning approaches are being increasingly used to predict these customer events accurately. Feature engineering, and selection is core to these approaches. Typically, there is extensive effort undertaken to handcraft features and manually iterate through alternate models. However, this is increasingly challenging given the increasing volume, dimensionality and temporal nature of the data. Domain experts can hypothesize relevant factors to consider for specific customer events, but, identifying the right set of feature across numerous permutations is a matter of conjecture and combinatorically complex. Automated feature engineering and discovery approaches offer a viable alternative for handling this combinatorial complexity in an optimal manner. In this session, we seek to present an approach to that effect, inspired by evolutionary algorithms and key considerations in enabling it at scale.

Tree-based approaches 2 are very popular due to their inherent ability in being visually representable for decision consumption as well as robustness and reduced training times. However, tree-based approaches lack the ability to generate variations in regression problems. The maximum variation generated by any single tree-based model is limited to the maximum number of training observations considering each observation to be a terminal node itself. Such a condition is an overfit model. This paper discusses the use of a hybrid approach of using two intuitive and explainable algorithms, CART 2 and k-NN 3 regression to improve the generalizations and sometimes the runtime for regression-based problems. The paper proposes first, the use of using a shallow CART algorithm (Tree depth lesser than optimal depth post pruning). Following the initial CART, a KNN Regression is performed at the terminal node to which the observation for prediction generation belongs to. This leads to a better variation as well as more accurate prediction than by just the use of a CART or a KNN regressor as well as another level of depth over an OLS regression.

AI is fast becoming integral to our daily lives - from image to facial recognition systems, machine learning powered predictive and prescriptive analytics, hyper-personalized systems, conversational applications, autonomous vehicles, identification of symptoms across diseases - the applications are numerous. With such a heavy reliance on the capabilities of AI, the need to trust these AI systems with all aspects of decision making is becoming critical. The predictions and prescriptions churned out by AI enabled systems are having a tremendous impact on how we view and experience life, death, and personal wellness. This is especially true of AI systems used in healthcare, driverless cars, or even drones deployed during warfare. However, most of us have little visibility and knowledge on how AI systems make the decisions they do. In the absence of this clarity, it is even more difficult to comprehend how the results are being applied and consumed across various fields. Many of the techniques and algorithms used for machine learning are either virtually opaque, or defy easy examination. This is largely true for most of the popular algorithms currently in use; specifically, deep learning neural network approaches. Fortunately for us, there is an aspect of AI, called Explainable AI, which can direct computer systems to operate as expected, and generate transparent explanations for decisions they make. In the future we will need to focus more on the Explainable AI component in order to further build our trust on AI systems that are used in decision-making.

With the advent of newer technology with greater computing power, big data and contemporary media channels, organizations have realized the importance of marketing mix modelling (MMM) and identified the benefits it entails that gives rise to cost saving opportunities and drives profitability. Marketers are under increasing pressure to move away from intuition based budgeting decisions to factual budgeting decisions, substantiated through quantitative evidence. In an attempt to understand how their marketing activities connect with real movements in sales and market share, the client, an Australian subsidiary of one of the world‚Äôs largest automotive manufacturer, wanted to conduct a MMM exercise and arrive at a clearer understanding of their Return on Marketing Investment. The client‚Äôs marketing strategy was designed around the themes of Media, Messaging and Brand Equity. Various levers were identified under each of these themes which are essentially the components of the marketing mix, to help assess the relative impact of marketing on enquiry and sales of the client‚Äôs product. Using historical marketing and sales data under each of the exhaustive components identified, Analyttica helped estimate the relative influence of the various components of the marketing mix, while controlling for other sales drivers such as seasonality. Proper capturing of the event and longevity of effect of the media channels on the outcome (in this case unit sales), is paramount for the success of any MMM application, which is heavily dependent on the suitable selection of the transformations such as decay (simple, logarithmic, exponential etc.), logistic, AdStock, and gamma. The appropriate selection of these transformation functions is highly contextual and driven by the skills, experience, knowledge and judgment of the modeler. As a surrogate to the knowledge, skill and experience of the modeler, we developed a heuristic optimization methodology for selection of the transformation functions for the media channels. The methodology considered six transformation functions competing against each other to arrive at the most appropriate one, that reduced the error of the model. This method is automated and has been developed into a prototype that can be applied in similar situations towards the process of measuring ‚ÄúAbove the Line‚Äù (ATL) marketing effectiveness and optimization. The above exercise highlighted the potential costs and benefits of all the components, which was then weighed against one another in order to build a media mix solution, to arrive at the effectiveness of each of the ATL channels, to enable the decisions around objective allocation of the marketing budget across channels. Madhav Kaushik has 12 years of experience in analytics and data science fields, across different industry verticals, with domain expertise in the Banking and Financial Services industry. At Analyttica, he leads the client solutions and product strategy group, providing data science solutions across the customer life cycle, from acquisition to customer engagement to risk mitigation.

Our paper gives complete solution to above mentioned critical issues using computer vision technology. i)Driver drowsiness is detected using an IR LED based tracking approach so that drowsiness can be detected in odd hours(mid-night) also,which is fitted inside the engine cab.This method is based on the spatial-temporal relationship which would detect the drowsiness more accurately.If the drowsiness is detected then a level I alarm is sounded. ii)Using a long range camera which is placed on the train engine,images are continuously monitored using streaming technique with a well trained object de- tection deep learning model using tensorflow as back-end to detect obstacles on the train track.Once an obstacle is detected a level II alarm is sent to the driver. This automized system helps the driver to be more productive in his job by helping him in the emergency situations to act quickly and in turn help save lives. In addition to saving lives this system also helps the Indian Railways in terms of monetary benefits by saving a lot of operational cost.

The complexity of the ad-tech ecosystem is constantly growing with brands running marketing activities across multiple channels, new targeting capabilities, and formats. Due to this, traditional digital measurement metrics like cost per click, return on investment, cost per conversion, etc. just scratch the surface while measuring the impact of marketing strategies. This measurement gap leads us to look at the incremental lift as a metric to measure the impact of a marketing strategy. Incrementality testing is a mathematical approach to differentiate between correlation and causation. We formulated different approaches to calculate incremental lift that can be implemented in the digital marketing ecosystem. Viewability is one of the methodologies that we are using for calculating incrementality in which we are measuring the effectiveness of an ad by comparing the users who are exposed to an ad versus users that are not exposed to an ad. Our methodologies cover concepts of test environment setup, randomization, bias handling, hypothesis testing, primary output and understanding different ways of using this output. We used this output for strategy planning and optimizations, helping us in achieving higher campaign efficiency. Having a set of different approaches to calculate incrementality gives us the flexibility to cater to a wide range of test cases having different setup challenges and restrictions.

Back in the 1990s, statistical machine learning methods began to replace the classical top-down rule-based approach to interpret languages, primarily due to accurate results, speed of processing and robustness of the algorithms. The advent of faster processors in the 2010s exponentially improved the performance of NLP algorithms. The need for clean and labeled training data also grew along with the emergence of faster processors and robust algorithms to improve the accuracy of the models. Statistical approaches have turned another corner and are now strongly focused on the usage of deep neural networks to both perform inferences on specific linguistic tasks and for developing robust algorithms. This paper By Abhishek Bhadra AVP at Genpact, Prakash Selvakumar AVP at Genpact, focuses on a machine learning approach to perform word segmentation and Hierarchy detection on medical documents (in form of any editable digital documents like PDFs). When text is extracted from digital pdf using python libraries such as PDFMiner, the output is in the form of Scriptio continua - a style of writing without spaces between the words or sentences. One of the ways to use this unseparated raw text in a meaningful way is known as word segmentation, which is a process to determine the word boundaries in a sentence. In this paper, they present a machine learning approach to build a word segmentation algorithm and also find the hierarchical structure in the text (for example Header1 or Header2 etc.). They leveraged the English Wikipedia dataset to build and train this advanced sequence to sequence model. The technique used in this paper has been successfully tested on medical domain data. We have also observed significant improvement in model accuracy by further training the algorithm with domain-specific documents (in the form of PDFs) ___________ Abhishek Bhadra is a seasoned Analytics expert and Bilingual AI/ML Practitioner.

Judges use this score as an input while deciding the quantum of punishment given to the criminal. However, data shows that the algorithm predicts higher risk for a black criminal compared to a white criminal who has committed the same offense and has a similar history of crime. Google‚Äôs image search algorithm could not differentiate between gorillas and dark-complexioned human beings, producing many offensive search results. Google has now ‚Äúswitched off‚Äù the search for gorilla, chimpanzee and similar labels in their image search algorithm. Traditionally, we tend to label these kinds of issues as ‚Äúalgorithmic biases‚Äù and try to fix the algorithms. But the reality is that it is the inherent bias in data on which the model is trained, which in turn is a result of past human behaviour, that has led to these erroneous results. We call this ‚Äúinductive bias‚Äù. While the above examples are extreme cases, inductive bias can creep into ML models that we develop for day-to-day business purposes, leading to wrong insights and counter-productive actions. For instance, in the developing countries, auto insurance premium prediction models tend to recommend higher premiums for customers living in less-affluent neighbourhoods. The origin of inductive bias lies in human bias and results don‚Äôt seem suspicious at first sight. But as ML and AI become mainstream in business and society, from potentially large business losses to unfair punishments and even loss of lives in extreme cases, inductive bias may be wreaking havoc without us realizing it. How do we overcome inductive bias? The solution to overcoming inductive bias lies in the emerging field of Data Ethnography, a cross-section of Data Science and Ethnography. Just like Ethnography provides insights into human behaviour, Data Ethnography provides insights into the behaviour of data that is being fed into the model and helps fix any inherent biases. Just like Excel and SQL, Data Ethnography is going to be an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Engineers in the immediate future.",28,Science & Technology,PT27M8S,1628,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6f5DRbvgp0/maxresdefault.jpg,,170,7,0,0,0

In most cases, machine intelligence is being used as a supplement to human decision making, thereby ‚Äúaugmenting‚Äù human intelligence. In this context Augmented Intelligence is proving to be more critical rather than Artificial Intelligence. Augmented Intelligence is also critical in considering the real-life constraints in leveraging machine intelligence within business context. Business leaders look at Augmented Intelligence as the next competitive edge to drive incremental top-line or bottom-line impact in their organisations. However, the path from ‚ÄúData‚Äù to ‚ÄúDollars‚Äù (business benefits) is time- intensive and full of challenges. Like an iceberg, the steps that require significant time and effort are mostly hidden under the water. Hence, the process of generating ‚ÄúDollars‚Äù from ‚ÄúData‚Äù appears exceptionally slow and frustrating to most business leaders. What if, we could navigate the entire data-to-dollar path in an agile manner? What if, we could get a data lake up and running in less than 15 days and create data marts in less than 30 days and have models implemented within 45 days? And last but not the least what if we could empower the business managers to do all the above themselves? The Actify Data Labs session will outline the agile approach and the tools needed for generating ‚ÄúDollars‚Äù from ‚ÄúData‚Äù at an extremely fast pace. And illustrate the same with a case study for consumer businesses within the Indian context.

In this talk, we describe how the fundamental technologies such as automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding are being used to create these new experiences. Bixby is Samsung's AI Platform the core of which is Bixby Voice ‚Äì an intelligent, personalized Assistant that enables users to use Voice for Samsung or 3rd party services. Bixby learns, evolves, and adapts to you to help you get things done seamlessly. Each feature of Bixby is designed to make your life easier, whether it's through touch, type, or voice. We talk about the evolution of Bixby Voice & associated research & development work at Samsung (including R&D centers in India). We talk about challenges in domain & intent classification for Natural Language understanding, and Deep Learning based solutions ranging from CNN vs. RNNs, Word vs. Character based models, Handling of variations of data and conflicts between data. We also describe recent efforts and results in improving speech recognition (ASR) performance for end users of Samsung's Bixby voice assistant. One of the main challenges with ASR is speaker variability. Different users, depending on their style, accent and other traits can pronounce the same word or sentence in many different ways. Hence, a one-size-fits-all approach works poorly for some segment of users, even though aggregate ASR performance may be quite high. Specifically, we present two techniques of improving ASR performance by considering the end user. The first is implemented at a macro level and uses a Hierarchical Accent Determination system dealing with accent variations. For English, eight accents [GB, US, Australian, Canadian, Spanish, Korean, and Indian & Chinese] are identified at macro level and accent-specific models corresponding to the identified accents are used. Similar approaches are applicable for languages like Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, which have significant accent variations at regional level. The second technique involves adapting the ASR models for a particular end user. Here, we describe how the acoustic model can be enhanced for a particular user's speaking style by training a new model on-device for that user. The key challenges in this problem are how to select utterances for training and adaptation, how to generate ground truth labels and handle errors in ground truth estimation. ______________________________________ VIKRAM VIJ Sr. Vice President atSamsung R&D Institute Dr. Vikram Vij received a Ph.D. and Master‚Äôs degree from the University of California Berkeley in Computer Science, an M.B.A. degree from Santa Clara University and a B.Tech. degree from IIT Kanpur in Electronics.

To reap the benefits, businesses will need agile information infrastructures and they will have to tackle some crucial concerns such as security, integration and data ownership. But apart from that, businesses will also need to experiment and build use cases. After all, IoT is not just a technical challenge, but also a question of business model innovation. IoT is fundamentally changing the way we do business. By connecting devices and sensors to the internet, we are entering an age where data analytics, connectivity, and automation are creating innovations and progress which were previously out of reach. As the Industry 4.0 and home automation movements gain more traction, we will see IoT devices and embedded systems becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives.

Often, the in-store marketing campaign suffers from poor execution and damage within the store which in-turn leads to poor ROI for manufacturers. Auditing the deployment of marketing materials is plagued by inaccuracy and lengthy turnaround times due to the extensive use of manual methods to audit these stores. Further, verification of the findings of these audits is a difficult and time-consuming process for manufacturers. Our proposed solution aims to increase the accuracy, while simultaneously reducing the turnaround times for these in-store audits by applying the latest in computer vision to make these audits objective and speedy. By using an advanced CNN architecture like Google‚Äôs InceptionNet, we train a neural network to detect brands and eventually different types of in-store displays. The output of the neural networks is used to automatically tag and score images from audits. Automating the process will also make the verification of these audits quick and easy for clients.

Qubole‚Äôs Presto-as-a-Service is primarily intended for Data Analysts who need to translate business questions into SQL queries. Since the questions are often ad-hoc, there is some trial and error involved; arriving at the final results may involve a series of SQL queries. By reducing the response time of these queries, the platform can reduce the time to insight and greatly benefit the business. Besides performance efficiencies, users benefit substantially from multiple supported data formats, continuous auto-scaling and efficient management of Presto clusters, improved user experience, and tightened security. In this webinar, we will cover the following agenda.

It has become widely accessible and is an important avenue for businesses to find creative solutions for problems. The major challenge with data though is how to use it effectively and innovatively. Lending to lower-income households and small and informal enterprises is one such challenge that not many businesses have ventured into. Many of the people from this background have limited (if at all) access to formal financial services and this not only inhibits their ability to make good decisions on the responsible and appropriate use of credit but also limits their awareness about financial services. Tala has solved this problem by using the data from mobile phones to evaluate and score applicants‚Äô creditworthiness and capacity. By doing so, it has not only made formal financial services accessible to the population that does not have access to it but has also empowered them and given them new hope for their future. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/",28,Science & Technology,PT26M48S,1608,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZmQ1x3w91v0/maxresdefault.jpg,,907,11,0,0,0

Forensic data analytics is an innovative fraud detection solution that enables the detection of fraudulent activity, non-standard or unethical behaviour and corrupt practices. Through the application of data analytic techniques and a detailed understanding of fraud and corruption, Control Risks is able to provide in-depth insights into a client‚Äôs relevant risks based on transactional data. Typical organisations lose 5% of revenue each year to fraud, with global fraud estimated to be approximately USD3.7 trillion dollars.It is assessed that by 2020, global fraud loses will likely exceed USD4.9 trillion dollars. The ongoing growth of social media is not only increasing fraud occurrences through data theft, identity takeover and opportunities for collusion, but is also exponentially increasing the reputational damage to companies caused by a large scale fraud. This indicates that typical corporations face a risk of fraud, no matter what size, country or sector they operate in. While fraud losses are significant at present, they are predicted to increase in the five year outlook. In an environment where fraud losses are so high, prevention is the most efficient and effective fraud risk management tool. Monitoring with data analytics : Despite the heightened external fraud risk environment, regular fraud monitoring for conflicts of interest, non-standard behaviour and fraudulent activity can significantly reduce a company‚Äôs fraud risk exposure and prevent damaging fraud losses. Control Risks specialises in bespoke, proactive fraud monitoring solutions that leverage data analytic capabilities to provide clients with a customizable approach to fraud detection. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/",28,Science & Technology,PT26M47S,1607,2d,sd,FALSE,,,127,1,0,0,0
