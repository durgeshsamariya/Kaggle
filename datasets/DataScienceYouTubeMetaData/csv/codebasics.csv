Now just a disclaimer, in order to learn deep learning you don't need to have such an expensive setup. Whatever laptop or personal computer you have should still work ok. If you have a requirements for running heavy jobs, you can utilize cloud for that. For me, NVIDIA gave 2500$ Titan RTX GPU for free and than I spent close to 1000$ for other parts to build this PC. My plan is to run some heavy deep learning jobs on this computer and I will be making videos on that in future.

Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don't know programming and they can try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn't need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.

There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself ""have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?"" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources, Great resources to learn math: https://www.mathsisfun.com/ https://www.khanacademy.org/ 3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily, Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

One can not become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures. This is the reason, interviewers ask data structure questions in any programming interview. They store data in a specific memory layout and based on what type of problem you are solving it might become necessary to use one data structure versus the other. The few most common data structures are array, linked list, tree, stack, queue, etc. In this video, we will understand what data structures are and their implementations in different programming languages.

We can't measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants.

You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as, #DataScience #WhatIsDataScience #DataScienceForBeginners #DataScientist #DataScienceTutorial #DataScienceWithPython #DataScienceCourse 1) Apache hadoop and apache spark: For database storage and distributed computing 2) Python and R: For data science programming 3) Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebook: For data visualization 4) Sklearn, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, PyTorch: For deep learning and machine learning Data scientist has become the most popular job in the market today and there is a huge career scope if you know how to do data science. Some of the use cases of data science in real life are, 1) Healthcare: Diagnostic prediction and accuracy 2) Finance: Fraud detection, predictive analysis on loans, stock market movement, company future 3) Shipping: Figure out best route for shipping 4) E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory pricing Very Simple Explanation Of Neural Network: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER2It2mIagI Form to fill out your definition of data science (Fill free yo use innovative, poetic, funny language) https://forms.gle/ukkQKddkiwna1H1L7 Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/codebasics",27,Education,PT6M47S,407,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JL_grPUnXzY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,48500,787,9,0,119

Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV.

Naive bayes theorm uses bayes theorm for conditional probability with a naive assumption that the features are not correlated to each other and tries to find conditional probability of target variable given the probabilities of features. We will use titanic survival dataset here and using naive bayes classifier find out the survival probability of titanic travellers. We use sklearn library and python for this beginners machine learning tutorial. GaussianNB is the classifier we use to train our model. There are other classifiers such as MultinomialNB but we will use that in part 2 of the tutorial. #MachineLearning #PythonMachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #Python #PythonTutorial #PythonTraining #MachineLearningCource #NaiveBayes Code: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/14_naive_bayes/14_naive_bayes_1_titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb Naive bayes theory video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8l0Vip5YUw Exercise solution: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/14_naive_bayes/Exercise/14_naive_bayes_exercise.ipynb Topics that are covered in this Video: 00:19 Basics of probability 00:52 Conditional probability 01:52 Bayes theorm 04:37 Coding: titanic crash survival 10:00 GaussianNB classifier Next Video: Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 15: Naive Bayes Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHIUYwN-5rM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw&index=16 Populor Playlist: Data Science Full Course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3us_ELKYSj_Fth2tIEkdKXvV Data Science Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdfbcdP75KI&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg Machine learning tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw Pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy matplotlib: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqwf4Vuj8oM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykoKxsYtow&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S Jupyter Notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_BzsPxwLOE&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuZPwzACannnFSn9qHn8to8 Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/codebasics,27,Education,PT13M38S,818,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PPeaRc-r1OI/maxresdefault.jpg,1,21183,318,10,0,65

If you are a newbie just starting out with programming then python is probably the best place to start. Also for experienced programmers it makes sense to learn python because code development speed is very good and one can to fast prototyping. Python is used heavily in data science, machine learning, scientific computing due to its rich set of libraries (modules). So come and learn python with me :) Topics that are covered in this Video: 0:08 It is easy to learn and very intuitive programming language 1:02 You can develop code really fast in python whereas with other languages it takes relatively longer time. This is so because, * The code syntax is compact * There is no compilation. Python is interpreted language so you save time on compiling the code. * It has rich set of libraries so for pretty much anything you can just import a library, write couple of lines using that and you are done 2:45 Rich set of libraries or modules 3:24 Used heavily in the fields of data science, machine learning and scientific computing 3:52 Plenty of job opportunities Next Video: 1.
