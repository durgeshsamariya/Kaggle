The first example multiplies one number with different cells in another column. In the second example, I cover how to create a cross-multiplication matrix. The trick of fixing lies in using the Function F4 button when selecting a range using Excel. When you press F4, it fixes both Column and Row. By pressing F4 again, you can fix only Columns. By pressing the third time, you can fi the row. When you press the fourth time, it returns back to normal.
