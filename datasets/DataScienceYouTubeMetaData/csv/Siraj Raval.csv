In this tutorial, I show you how I built my first game for the Oculus Virtual Reality platform in C# using Unity. Baton Master lets you practice conducting in a simulated orchestral environmental. I wanted to understand the process of encoding real-world knowledge into game mechanics. I recorded a 3 hour screencast of me rebuilding it from scratch but i condensed it as much as I could to focus on the most relevant parts for you. I'm also releasing the code so please use it as you need it to learn, build, and explore the incredible world of Virtual Reality.

Tren is a tech youtuber and one of my more vocal critics. We talk about the pros & cons of online courses, Computer Science, our backgrounds, the youtube lifestyle, and he freestyle raps about data structures at the end. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. The future of Education depends on all of us irreverently pushing the boundaries of what is perceived as normal by our peers. Education is not their word to define, it’s yours. We have to learn how to learn using the Internet, questioning every archaic tool that’s being used now, from the physical lecture hall to the proctored exam. Gamify your learning and don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t. Computer Science is my one true love, and I refuse to accept that all the ways it's being taught now are enough to educate the world. I want every man, woman, and child on this planet to have basic Computer Science literacy. Knowledge and action are inextricably connected, and the best way to prepare ourselves for the technological changes happening across every spectrum of our lives is with this knowledge. We have to completely reinvent Computer Science Education these next few years, and then the rest of Education will follow.

In just 2 weeks, hundreds of developers from around the world signed up to join the fight against the novel coronavirus, using publicly available datasets and algorithms to come up with relevant solutions. The top 3 submissions, winning $3500 in prizes, stood out from the rest in terms of their algorithmic and reporting quality. In this episode, I’m going to announce each of their backgrounds, as well as dive into the various machine learning techniques they used to predict a suitable treatment for Coronavirus. The top submission identified a compound called Remdesivir as the the most promising treatment for COVID-2019, due to its high scoring inhibitory potential when docked against the Coronavirus main Protease. Remdesivir was recently shown to be effective in treating the first US patient infected with COVID-2019, but is currently undergoing clinical trials to gain FDA approval. These findings help confirm it’s potential as an effective COVID-2019 treatment. I’ll explain more in the vid, Enjoy!

The aim of this episode is to get you up to speed as fast as possible so that you can participate. This challenge is hosted by Francois Chollet, the creator of the popular deep learning library Keras, and there are still 3 months to go. The goal is to create an algorithm that can learn the relationship between input-output pairs of colored tiles. Sounds simple at first, but upon closer inspection, creating an algorithm that's able to do so given such a small dataset requires genuine AI innovation. Deep Learning won't work because it requires big datasets and expensive compute, so even though this challenge is difficult, it's also the most accessible! We'll be learning about the dataset, related paper, and the various techniques that Kagglers have already attempted. Then, we'll learn about Neural Program Synthesis and future directions that could ultimately solve this problem. Enjoy! Subscribe for more educational videos! It means a lot to me.

In this episode, we'll analyze Meena's architecture by comparing it to the previous generations of chatbots, then build our own 'DeepFake' chatbot using state of the art tools for text, audio, and video generation. I'm using the increasingly popular term DeepFake here because deep learning will increasingly be used to mimic/fake human personalities.

They introduced two key ideas here, ""reversible layers"" and ""locality sensitive hashing"". Both of these concept build on about a decade of research in neural networks applied to NLP, so to truly understand the Reformer, we've got to understand the timeline of deep learning based NLP. In this episode, I'll take you on a journey through the advances that lead up to the Reformer, what the relevant applications of it are, and how you can get started building your own text application with it today in a few lines of Python code. All the code I demonstrate in this video is from various developers across GitHub, I do not claim any of it as my own, I am using them as examples to enable more people outside of Academia to understand modern NLP.

In this episode, I'm going to explain what some of the latest advancements in graph networks are and how you can leverage them to build your own graph network in a few lines of Python code.

We'll be weighing the pros and cons of the Deep Graph, Graph Nets, and PyTorch Geometric library as well.

This has serious real world consequences! In Medicine, this could mean misdiagnosing a patient. In autonomous vehicles, this could mean ignoring a stop sign. Machines are increasingly tasked with making life or death decisions like that, so it's important that we figure out how to correct this problem! I found a new, relatively obscure yet extremely fascinating paper out of Google Research that tackles this problem head on. In this episode, I'll explain the work of these researchers, we'll write some code, do some math, do some visualizations, and by the end I'll freestyle rap about AI and genomics.

There were hardly any resources designed for absolute beginners and the field was dominated by PhDs. In 2020, thanks to the extraordinary contributions of everyone in this community, all that has changed. It’s easier than ever before to enter into this field, even without an IT background. We’ve seen brave entrepreneurs figure out how to deploy this technology to save lives (medical imaging, automated diagnosis) and accelerate Science (AlphaFold). We’ve seen algorithmic advances (deepfakes) and ethical controversies (automated surveillance) that shocked the world. The AI field is now a global, cross-cultural movement that's not limited to academics alone. And that’s something all of us should be proud of, we’re all apart of this. I’ve packed a lot into this episode! I’ll give my annual lists of the best ML language and libraries to learn this year, how to learn ML in 2020, as well as 8 predictions about where this field is headed.

If people started thinking that if they put something high quality and original on Github, a random youtuber would come along and claim it as their own work, then people might just start putting fewer things on GitHub to begin with, and the world would be a worse place. That's why its so critical to not plagiarize. The ideal world we want to live in is one where the people who actually do high quality & original work are the ones who get the credit. It took my reputation blowing up in my face for me to realize that, both in the Neural Qubit paper case & my content more generally. I hope my painful fall serves as a valuable lesson to everyone else. This is my apology video.

The midterm assignment was to create a paid machine learning web app, and after receiving countless incredible submissions, I've decided to share my favorite 5 publicly. I was surprised by how many students in the course had never coded before and to see them building a full-stack web app in a few weeks was a very fulfilling experience. Use these examples as a template to help you ideate on potential business ideas to make a positive impact in the world using machine learning. And if you'd like, be sure to reach out and support each of the students I've demoed here today in any way can you offer. They've been working their butts off. Enjoy!

The way it works is that once signed up, a business will paste a code snippet into their website, and then they'll get access to a dashboard that tells them how many fraudulent accounts they have. Our app will use machine learning to automatically remove suspected fraud accounts, and flag likely ones for review.

This was School of AI's first ever conference that I hosted in Granada, Spain. I wanted to meet the faces of our learning community in person, to see the work they were doing, and celebrate the collective future we’re all striving towards. So I searched for Castle’s in Europe on Airbnb, and found a villa in Spain! Then I invited some of our most active community organizers to come to Spain and live in the Villa for 3 days. I had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be a life changing experience. In this video, you'll see exclusive footage from the event and interviews with the attendees.

That is easier said than done, and in this video i'll show you how you should read and dissect a research paper so you can quickly implement it programmatically. The paper we'll be implementing in this video is called Neural Style transfer, that applies artistic filters to an image using 3 loss functions. Its a great starting point, i'll demo it using code, animations, and math. Enjoy! Code for this video: https://github.com/llSourcell/Research_to_Code Please Subscribe! And like. And comment.

Yes! Normally, doctors train for years to do this and the error rate is still relatively high. From mammograms to cat scans, AI can diagnose a disease better than any human can if given the right training dataset. This will drastically reduce patient death, save medical practices a lot of money, and aid doctors in the patient care process. Everyone will win and its important to remember that AI won't replace doctors, it will become the most powerful tool they've ever used.

We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost. VERSE 1 i was never the type of kid to follow the rules my parents got so mad they said ""study for school!"" i don't give a fuck about tests and shit, don't try to grade me, don't tell me to go study and shit, i have my own dreams own life own mind online bitch try to take me offline i aint got time tryna to make my own way in this world trying make it, give liberation a whirl so lonely its just me myself one and only real friends is hard so many phonys its all good I'm moving up i know das wasup life is a marathon ill run till i throw up. Raised in houston but moved up to NYC to join that Ivy University damn right i was dazed and confused i refused to lose i had nothin to choose But then i found a lab for robots, huh, damn that shit had my name on it. Charlie Chaplin Do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed. the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. the hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. and so long as men die, liberty will never perish. VERSE 2 I was up till the crack of dawn tryin find all the bots in my mind tryin to read shit online then i walked straight up to professor A ""yo can i work in ur lab?' ""sure, and we hope you stay"" those words were sweet to my ears. signed up started playin with motors n gears no fear i was lead engineer, revolution was here ""so visionary!"" chuckle i made a robot startup tryin to make a robot so hot make some toast and a cold pot clean ya dish a whole lot but didn't work we failed a whole lot uh no money no sales i lost it i failed. passion was lost, taken by jack frost, no longer the boss, robotics was lost...i packed my bags. I left for the West. Maybe I could find purpose again i didn't fuckin know Charle Chaplin You the people have the power! The power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful. To make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite! VERSE 3 Shoutout to SF my new home city fuckin love this place man its so very pretty, I'm a dichotomy sirajology i guess i learned robots were still hot to me. i be machine learnin neural nets Google no Alphabet all that shit uh, world is in flames we gotta make shit better make some robots do some real shit that matters. im tired of all the pain in the world all the hate all the lies all the war all the spies, tryin make shit blow up for miles, tryin to make us wild, back to the river nile, we gotta put brains in the robots make em so smart so hot fix shit a whole lot then we free to do a whole lot yea lets end all them fuckin sweatshops but ay i think we can do it. don't u?
