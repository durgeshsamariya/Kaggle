I am calling this an impossible pivot table because once you group daily dates to months and years, you are not allowed to add a calculated item inside the pivot table to show a variance. Many ideas flashed through my mind: Run the data through PowerPivot and used Named Sets. Make two pivot tables side by side, one showing monthly and one showing YTD.

Mansoor asked an interesting question for today's New Widescreen Podcast. Can you assign a Color to each Unique Value in a Column, and then automatically re-use that Color when the same Value is entered. Bill understands that in order to perform the required spec, this operation will require a VBA Event Handler Macro to analyze each entry. However, the logic is similar to what you would use in Excel: use =MATCH() to figure out if the Value appears above. If the Value is found, then re-use the Color from the matching Cell. Otherwise, create a random Color using three =RANDBETWEEN() Functions. Follow Bill in Episode #1718 to see how the result is achieved and the Color Values are applied.

I spent a week in Lucerne Switzerland at the 8th annual Trainer Days. This is a team of Microsoft Office Trainers who began getting together once a year to teach each other new tricks in Office. Today, they allow others to attend. I was their guest speaker for Trainertage 2013. Now, the obvious problem: I don't speak German. But they were patient. I spoke slowly, and everyone got along well. My friend Tony Dejonker helped with translation during my first session, but it was decided that my ""Slow English"" was good enough for the remaining three sessions. First observation: doing training for other trainers is tougher than my normal sessions. I always learn a new trick or two from the audience in a normal session; usually someone in row 2 shows me up. I expect it, and have a prize for it. At Trainertage, it was less than 1 minute and 30 seconds into my presentation when the first trick came from row 2, and more flooded in from row 2 all night. Some even from row 1 and row 3! Second observation: When I would watch another trainer's session in Deutsch, I would learn new stuff. I couldn't understand the language, but I would pick up things that I had not seen in the U.S. These new friends of mine all learned from books in German and attended their own sessions and had learned a whole new set of tricks. I joked that I was going to steal these for the podcast, and they were all cool with that. ""It is not stealing, it is sharing"". They learned from me, and I learned from them. In my first episode of Things That I Learned at Trainertage, I lead off with a trick from the mother of Trainertage; Tanja Kuhn. Yes, you might be smart enough to build a dynamic range using OFFSET and COUNTA, but you won't have to anymore with this clever twist on using Ctrl+T. Today, in Episode #1632, Bill shows us a new dimension in Dynamic Ranges. ...This blog is the video podcast companion to the book, Learn Excel 2007 through Excel 2010 from MrExcel.
