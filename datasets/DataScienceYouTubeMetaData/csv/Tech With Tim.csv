It also discusses why I'm so passionate about learning and teaching programming and how I started this channel. When I was young I was fascinated by how things worked, specifically computer and electronics. So I started doing my own research and investigating my interests. Shortly after doing so I came across programming and fell in love. I was one of those kids that never had to try in school, that could show up for a test and get an A with little to no effort. This meant I never felt challenged, never had to think, and programming forced me to think. It was an addictive feeling solving difficult problems and using the full capacity of my mind. So I learned more and more, and here we are today.

I talk about the differences in cloud mining and hardware mining. In this video I explain why I believe cloud mining is a better option than gpu mining. Cloud mining takes much less time and effort to setup and get running smoothly than hardware mining does. It simply requires the clicks of a few buttons while hardware mining requires countless hours of work and debugging to get your rig running at peak performance. Cloud mining may be more expensive but it makes up for it in the time you save. Genesis Mining: https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1634311 Please leave a LIKE and SUBSCRIBE for more content!

Today I do a Recursion and Memoization Tutorial in Python. In this video I explain a programming technique called recursion. This is the practice of making a function call to the function it is declared in. You do this to continue to simplify a problem until you are at a base case in which you can know how to solve. However this can be quite slow so to speed up the process you use memorization. This stores all the answers you've already calculated in a hash table where they can be referenced later.
