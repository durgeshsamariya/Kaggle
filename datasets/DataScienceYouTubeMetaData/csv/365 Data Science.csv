The same applies for corporations. Business leaders (or CEOs) aim to set up their companies in a profitable way. They expect to earn more money than the money that was initially invested by shareholders. They expect to grow, and – in addition to being profitable – business leaders want to meet and exceed customer expectations. In this course we will focus on objective expectations. Given that a company has multiple stakeholder groups with different and sometimes conflicting expectations, it is up to the CEO and the Board of Directors, to set the expectations. The CEO with his or her management team is responsible for the daily operations, while the board of directors is focused on the longer term, the strategy and vision for the company.

Think of this model as a black box. We feed input, and it delivers an output. For instance, we may want to create a model that predicts the weather tomorrow, given meteorological information for the past few days. The input we’ll feed to the model could be metrics, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. The output we will obtain would be the weather forecast for tomorrow. Training is a central concept in machine learning, as this is the process through which the model learns how to make sense of the input data. Once we have trained our model, we can simply feed it with data and obtain an output. Enjoy the video!

And that’s what we’ve done for 3 consecutive years. Since 2018 we have explored 1001 data scientist LinkedIn profiles to uncover the most interesting trends in the data science field. In this video we will go through the most important findings from the last 3 years. In fact, we have created a very cool and interactive PowerBI dashboard which you can use to analyze the data yourself here. 👇🏻Access the Power BI Dashboard👇🏻 ✅https://bit.ly/2xRUbQd 👇🏻GET SPECIAL OFFER for the Complete Data Science Training 👇🏻 ✅https://bit.ly/39fvjzZ 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube ✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 According to the data, the average data scientist from 2018 to 2020 is a male with a second-tier degree, coming from a quantitative background, which is not necessarily data science or computer science. Their preferred programming language is Python, but they’d often know R and SQL. Many of the new data scientist positions are being filled by people who are already data scientists, so the field feels much more saturated. Getting into data science still looks like a great opportunity, but the ‘data scientist’ position becomes more and more exclusive. Our sample shows that at least 80% of the people held a minimum of a Master’s degree. This isn’t as surprising, considering data science is a field that expects advanced know-how from the person — usually achieved by graduate or postgraduate types of education, or independent advanced research in other cases.

The answer here is a resounding “yes!”. Roughly 13% of current data scientists have an Economics degree. For comparison, the most well-represented discipline is data science and analysis, which takes up 21% of the pie. Therefore, Economics is a competitive discipline when it comes to data science. First, unlike STEM disciplines, social studies help develop great presentational skills which are essential for any data scientist. Through presentations and open discussions, students learn how to present a topic, as well as argue for or against a given statement. These activities result in developing a confident and credible way of showcasing actionable insights. Moreover, most econ majors deeply care about human behavior and response to different stimuli. Furthermore, Economics frequently intertwines with Mathematics, Finance, Psychology, and Politics. Therefore, an economist’s approach is always meant to be interdisciplinary. Finally, the technical capabilities of an economist are often quite impressive. An average economist has a good understanding of Machine Learning without really referring to it as such. Linear regressions and logistic regressions are studied in almost all Economics degrees. 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://bit.ly/2USIvFA ✅Telegram: https://t.me/c365datascience ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Twitter: https://twitter.com/365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program👇🏻 ✅https://bit.ly/34uqUa7 Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

In short, we can say that this position requires you to build, maintain, and manipulate database systems. And, very often, you’ll have to use the data stored in the databases you created to develop ad-hoc and recurring reports. To this end, you will need to write and test SQL code, as well as create stored procedures, functions, and views. Let’s discuss some of the technical skills an SQL developer needs on the job. Naturally, you need to be proficient in SQL. I’m sure you didn’t see this one coming. Some of the most popular database management systems that allow you to work with versions of the Structured Query Language are MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. What formal qualifications do you need to apply as an SQL developer? This is a position that is a suitable position for junior professionals. However, in most cases, you need some initial experience. Almost all job ads we analysed required 1 or 2 (and sometimes more) years of experience with SQL and relational database tools in a professional environment. 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://bit.ly/2R5wmLk ✅Telegram: https://t.me/c365datascience ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Twitter: https://twitter.com/365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program👇🏻 ✅https://bit.ly/2URnr0W Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

Having the words “Data Science” next to “education” in your resume is a sure-fire way to get the express treatment when applying for jobs in the field. Thus, the signalling aspect of such a degree is extremely important. Of course, the main reason is that potential employers believe you have a great interest in the job. They don’t have to worry about programming skills, analytical understanding of statistical results, or your data-storytelling abilities. This is crucial because some great statisticians lack the coding pedigree, while some programming wonderkids lack the knowledge to extract insights from a dataset.

If small companies want to level the playing field, cloud computing is critical for their data science teams. ✅Get 20% OFF all learning plans! http://bit.ly/2TVaJ0O To understand the advantages cloud computing provides when it comes to data science, let’s imagine a world with as much data as we have today, but without servers. In such an unfortunate scenario, firms would need databases that run locally, right? So, every time when you, as a data scientist, want to engage in new analyses or refresh an existing algorithm, you’d have to transfer information to your machine from the central database, and then proceed to operate locally. This unfortunate world would have several main drawbacks... For example, manual intervention would be necessary to retrieve data... Your machine becomes a single point of failure for the analyses you have worked on locally... Processing speed would be equivalent to the computing power of your computer... Chances are you will be able to work with a limited amount of data due to the limited computing resources at your disposal... Moreover, under this setup, you wouldn’t be able to leverage real-time data to build recommender systems or any type of machine learning algorithms that require ‘live’ data. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube ✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Doesn’t sound like the perfect scenario, does it? Well, that’s why we invented servers. And then these servers had drawbacks of their own. Fortunately, we now have clouds. They overshadow local servers in almost every conceivable aspect. And, in fact, data scientists should be focused on developing great algorithms, testing hypothesis, taking advantage of all available data without having to wait hours to see the results of the tests they are performing and certainly without having to worry how much memory space they have left on their computer. And yes, sometimes data scientists do end up waiting for long hours for an algorithm to train, but with a cloud, they have the option to pay more and get the job done faster. That’s yet another advantage of cloud computing over servers. 👇🏻Get 20% OFF the Data Science Training ✅​http://bit.ly/2TVaJ0O 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: http://bit.ly/33a4BWx ✅Telegram: https://t.me/c365datascience ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Twitter: https://twitter.com/365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program👇🏻 ✅http://bit.ly/3378UlA Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

We have conducted several studies on this topic to determine what are the best degrees for an aspiring Data Scientist. So, in this video, we’ll go over the level, discipline and university rank you should be looking at when deciding what degree is worth pursuing or if your current degree is suitable for the field. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube👇🏻 ✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Our results show that virtually all data scientists have graduated from an institution of higher education. This includes Bachelors, Masters, MBAs, and Ph.Ds. However, some degrees seem to be much more popular than others. In fact, only around 2% of all data scientists in our sample owned an MBA, but that’s not entirely surprising. If you decide to do an MBA, chances are you’re not aiming at the hands-on technical data scientist role on the team. Bachelors, Masters, and Ph.Ds round up roughly 95% of the data, with 75% being split among Masters and PhDs. This means that roughly 3 out of every 4 data scientists have at least a master’s degree. So, yes, going for a graduate program is highly recommended. Of course, if you think a B.A. is as high as you want to go, there is no need to be discouraged. Nearly 20% of the data scientists in our sample had only completed an undergraduate prior to entering the field. And while this number is not high, the percentage of data scientists holding only a Bachelor’s degree has been steadily growing over the last three years. This is a refreshing indicator that shows employers are starting to value skills over years of schooling. In other words, a qualified candidate today has a higher chance of breaking into the field, compared to two years ago.

Population variance, denoted by sigma squared, is equal to the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the population mean, divided by the total number of observations. Sample variance, on the other hand, is denoted by s squared and is equal to the sum of squared differences between observed sample values and the sample mean, divided by the number of sample observations minus 1. 👇🏻 Check out the full article 👇🏻 ✅http://bit.ly/2v15NPp 👇🏻 Follow us on YouTube 👇🏻 ✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 While variance is a common measure of data dispersion, in most cases the figure you will obtain is pretty large and hard to compare as the unit of measurement is squared. The easy fix is to calculate its square root and obtain a statistic known as standard deviation. In most analyses you perform, standard deviation will be much more meaningful than variance. Alright. The other measure we still have to introduce is the coefficient of variation. It is equal to the standard deviation, divided by the mean. Another name for the term is relative standard deviation. This is an easy way to remember its formula – it is simply the standard deviation relative to the mean. As you probably guessed, there is a population and sample formula once again.

To recap: any form of post-graduate degree in a quantitative field gives you a pretty good chance of success, with Computer Science being the most-represented major. Apart from an education, you also need some sort of experience credentials to your name. To understand the methodology we used, you can check out the article linked in the description. For reference, the results suggest that roughly 35% of current Data Scientists have already had a job in the same position. This means that the remaining 65% had a different occupation prior to that. Therefore, roughly 2 out of every 3 data scientists are on their first data scientist job in the field. However, don’t expect to become a data scientist right after school. As little as 2% of all data scientists started off with no previous position on their resume. And even this number in itself sounded suspiciously *high* to us. Either way, to land even an entry-level position, you still need some previous experience elsewhere.

They represent 1.0.0 as a stable version of pandas with a strengthened API, which has also been cleaned of many prior version deprecations. Here are the most notable improvements that come with 1.0.0. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube👇🏻 ✅https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 One. The dedicated string and Boolean data types These features are still “experimental”, which means that further improvements are expected to happen in the near future. So, as of yet, pandas will not automatically assign “string” or “bool” to your data. Two. The select data types method is much quicker now! It relies on vectorization instead of iterating over a loop. So, you can run select data types, string to pull all string values, or select data types, “bool” to retrieve the Boolean data from a DataFrame, provided that you have set them as such beforehand. Three. We now can enjoy the pandas, NA scalar that denotes missing values. Using pandas, NA is a new concept in the scientific ecosystem of Python, and its goal is to provide an indicator for missing values that can be used consistently and successfully across data types. Four. A method that will convert the data types of columns containing such null values has been introduced – convert data types. Five. The well-known info has been improved. It is much more readable and this does help you to explore your data in a quicker and more efficient way. Six. Now we also have the “to markdown” – this new method allows you to display a Series or DataFrame object as a markdown table.

Great! Our free step by step guide will walk you through how to start a career in data science: https://bit.ly/31SdoMt A recent report by The Hindu states that there are an estimated 97,000 data analytics job openings in India (Bengaluru accounts for 24% of these job openings, while Delhi/NCR for 22%). Since the data science field is progressing at an extremely fast rate, the huge demand for data science talent, especially in the Technology/IT and Industrial domain, can hardly catch up with the supply of skilled data scientists. That’s why it doesn’t come as a surprise that a significant part of the data scientists in India (more than 40%) have received a ‘data scientist’ job title within the last 24 months. So, becoming a data scientist in India seems like a truly golden opportunity. Let’s see what that means in terms of salaries! According to upgrad.com, “data scientist” is the highest paying job in India. To be more precise, the average data scientist salary listed on Glassdoor is above 1,000,000 rupees per year and it could go up to 2,000,000 rupees for more experienced candidates. Of course, corporations based in large cities like Mumbai and Bangalore offer higher salaries. But keep in mind that this may soon change. Many international companies prefer to open an office in Hyderabad, as it’s much more affordable. No wonder giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and P&G already call Hyderabad their home. And that translates into even more career opportunities for data scientists in India...

For decades financial analysts have relied on data to extract valuable insights, but the rise of Data Science and Machine Learning has brought upon a new era in the field. Now, more than ever, automated algorithms and complex analytical tools are being used hand-in-hand to get ahead of the curve. So, let’s explore the 5 ways in which financial institutions use these methods to their advantage! 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube👇🏻 ✅​https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Number 5: Fraud Prevention Fraud prevention is a part of financial security that deals with fraudulent activities, such as identity theft and credit card schemes. Abnormally high transactions from conservative spenders, or out of region purchases often signal credit card fraud. Whenever such are detected, the cards are usually automatically blocked, and a notification is sent out to the owner. That way, banks can protect their clients, as well as themselves and even insurance companies, from huge financial losses in a short period of time. The opportunity costs far outweigh the small inconvenience of having to make a phone call or issue another card. The role data science plays here comes in the form of random forests and other methods that determine whether there are sufficient factors to indicate suspicion. Number 4: Anomaly Detection Unlike Fraud Prevention, the goal here is to detect the problem, rather than prevent it. The reason is that we can’t classify an event “anomalous” as it happens but can only do so in the aftermath. The main application of this anomaly detection in finance comes in the form of catching illegal insider trading...

And after that? Well, it was in the lead in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well! With a mean base salary of more than $100,000, being a data scientist seems like the dream job of this century. But why is that? Of course, like any other business-related phenomenon, it follows the basic laws of economics – supply and demand. The demand for data science professionals is very high, while the supply is too low. Think about computer science years ago. The internet was becoming a “thing” and people were making serious cash off it. Everybody wanted to become a programmer, a web-designer or anything, really, that would allow them to be in the computer science industry. Salaries were terrific and it was exceptional to be there. As time passed by, the salaries plateaued as the supply of CS guys and girls started to catch up with the demand. That said, the industry is still above average in terms of pay. The same thing is happening to the data science industry right now. Demand is really high, while supply is still low. And, as stated in an extensive joint research performed by IBM, Burning Glass Technologies, and Business-Higher Education Forum, this tendency will continue to be strong for the years to come. This, by itself, determines that salaries will be outstanding. Consequently, people are very much willing to get into data science...

Much like their blockbuster counterpart, data architects create the database from scratch. They design the way data will be retrieved, processed, and consumed. Data architects are technical experts who adapt dataflow management and data storage strategy to a wide range of businesses and solutions. They’re in charge of continually improving the way data is collected and stored. In addition, data architects control access to data. So, all you corporate spies out there – now you know who to look for. Data architects are also responsible for design patterns, data modeling, service-oriented integration, and business intelligence domains. They often partner with fellow data scientists and IT guys to reach the company’s data strategy goals.

Data engineers are the Jedi Knights of data science. They rely on a blend of analysis, wisdom, experience, and judgment to make key decisions for a company’s success. A data engineer is a self-starter who is inspired to complete more than your usual number of tasks. Data engineers are the ones to take things further up the data science pipeline. They use the data architects’ work as a steppingstone and then pre-processes the available data. These are the people who ensure the data is clean and organized and ready for the analysts to take over. Data engineers also implement complex, large scale big data projects with a focus on collecting, managing, analyzing and visualizing large data sets. They are also the ones who turn raw data into insights using various tool sets, techniques, and cloud-based platforms. That said, for a data engineer, knowledge of data modeling for both data warehousing and Big Data is a must, along with experience in the Big Data space (Hadoop Stack like M/R, HDFS, Pig, Hive, etc.). Of course, the ability to write, analyze, and debug SQL queries will helps the aspiring data engineer score high on any employer’s recruitment list. In terms of soft skills, they are great team-players. A data engineer knows how to actively collaborate with data scientists and executives to build solutions and platforms that meet, or even exceed a company’s business needs... Enjoy watching!

So, categorical data describes categories or groups. One example is car brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi – they show different categories. Another instance is answers to yes and no questions. If we ask questions like: -Are you currently enrolled in a university? Or -Do you own a car? Yes and no would be the two groups of answers that can be obtained. This is categorical data. On the other hand, numerical data, as its name suggests, represents numbers. It is further divided into two subsets: discrete and continuous. Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter. A good example would be the number of children that you want to have. Even if you don’t know exactly how many, you are absolutely sure that the value will be an integer such as 0, 1, 2, or even 10. Continuous data is infinite and impossible to count. For instance, your weight can take on every value in some range... Enjoy watching!

Therefore, we read the following as “Variable “Y” follows a Chi-Square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom”. Very few events in real life follow such a distribution. In fact, Chi-Squared is mostly featured in statistical analysis when doing hypothesis testing and computing confidence intervals.

BI analysts are fierce business performance ninjas who possess a blend of business vision, consultant abilities and profound understanding of data. They join forces with senior management to shape and develop a data strategy. Analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), accurate overview of business performance and identifying areas that need improvement are also specialties in the BI analyst’s domain. And what exactly do BI analysts do? Well, they focus primarily on analyses and reporting of past historical data. Once the relevant data is in the hands of the BI Analyst (that’s… monthly revenue, customer, sales volume, etc.), they must quantify the observations, calculate KPIs, and examine the measures to extract insights. Of course, the most important aspect of a BI analyst’s job is to continually improve their company’s competitive positioning. Therefore, they examine their competitors, data trends, seasonality, and other random effects to quickly identify issues and best practices. On top of that, they create killer graphs and dashboards to review major decisions and measure effectiveness. So, in a word, if you want to have an impact on the business world, become a BI analyst. Well, maybe that’s easier said than done. But let’s see how much a BI analyst makes per year, maybe that’ll have some inspirational effect on you… Enjoy watching!

For starters, we use the lower-case letter “t” to define a Students’ T distribution, followed by a single parameter in parenthesis, called “degrees of freedom”. As we mentioned in the last video, it is a small sample size approximation of a Normal Distribution. In instances, where we would assume a Normal distribution were it not for the limited number of observations, we use the Students’ T distribution. For instance, the average lap times for the entire season of a Formula 1 race follow a Normal Distribution, but the lap times for the first lap of the Monaco Grand Prix would follow a Students’ T distribution. Now, the curve of the students’ T distribution is also bell-shaped and symmetric. However, it has fatter tails to accommodate the occurrence of values far away from the mean. That is because if such a value features in our limited data, it would be representing a bigger part of the total. Another key difference between the Students’ T Distribution and the Normal one is that apart from the mean and variance, we must also define the degrees of freedom for the distribution… Enjoy Watching! *** LINK TO OUR PROBABILITY PLAYLIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFfQroTgZnxtnfht3BzBHVfxodX9AR9F LINK TO OUR ‘’STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION’’ VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhtmW28slDw Follow us on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/2XCX550 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/31tcCFI Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com #probability #distribution #datascience",27,Education,PT2M42S,162,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t4hpjK1z5uY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,6752,122,7,0,3

So, a transformation is a way in which we can alter every element of a distribution to get a new distribution with similar characteristics. For Normal Distributions we can use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division without changing the type of the distribution.

Data analysts are the real troopers of data science. They’re the ones who are involved in gathering data, structuring databases, creating and running models, and preparing advanced types of analyses to explain the patterns in the data that have already emerged. A data analyst also overlooks the basic part of predictive analytics. That’s the “elevator pitch of the data analyst”. But to really get an idea of what it means to be part of a team like that, we need to look at what a data analyst does. As it turns out, quite a lot. A data analyst is both a thinker and a doer who doesn’t hesitate to roll up their sleeves and dig into the numbers. Data analysts extract and analyze data with a “can do” approach and then present data-driven insights to underpin decision making. They also develop and build analytics models and approaches as the basis for a company’s strategy and vision. On top of that, they are often responsible for identifying and extracting key business performance, risk and compliance data, and converting it into easy-to-digest formats. So, as you can see, agility to shift between strategic projects and operational activities a must. If you think that sounds a bit lonely… Think again! Data analysts are great team players and work closely with various departments and leaders within the organization. That’s super important if they want to be effective in this role. So, the ability to communicate well and influence is critical here… Enjoy watching! *Special Offer 20% Off*. Complete Data Science Online Training Program.

In this Statistics Tutorial, we are going to introduce one of the most commonly found continuous distributions – the normal distribution. For starters, we will define what types of events follow a Normal Distribution, and then we will examine some of its distinct characteristics. Enjoy watching! *** So, we define a Normal Distribution using a capital letter N followed by the mean and variance of the distribution. We read the following notation as “Variable “X” follows a Normal Distribution with mean “mu” and variance “sigma” squared”. When dealing with actual data we would usually know the numerical values of mu and sigma squared. The normal distribution frequently appears in nature, as well as in life, in various shapes of forms. For example, the size of a full-grown male lion follows a normal distribution. Many records suggest that the average lion weight between 150 and 250 kilograms, or 330 to 550 pounds. Of course, there exist specimen which fall outside of this range. Lions weighing less than 150, or more than 250 kilograms tend to be the exception rather than the rule. Such individuals serve as outliers in our set and the more data we gather, the lower part of the data they represent… *** LINK TO OUR PROBABILITY PLAYLIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFfQroTgZnxtnfht3BzBHVfxodX9AR9F LINK TO ‘’THE POISSON DISTRIBUTION’’ VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbLfV0wOeyc&t Follow us on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/2xsB6DQ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/3eg9ORV Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com #statistics #tutorial #datascience",27,Education,PT3M54S,234,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IhtmW28slDw/maxresdefault.jpg,1,7662,158,1,0,3

Why work for a data science startup? Sure, big data science consultancies have the stability and the benefits every aspiring data scientist strives for. However, you may find yourself working on predictable and often repetitive tasks with little opportunities for growth. At least for the first few years. Startups, on the other hand, allow you to develop your skillset by trying new things and handling a variety of challenges. Responsibilities there change quite frequently. So, within less than a year you could be doing something entirely different… And a lot more interesting for you than what you were initially hired for. In other words, the sky is the limit! We based our research on insight from KDnuggets, LinkedIn, and Forbes to discover the best startups to watch in 2019. Then we picked our top 10 – the fastest growing machine learning and tech startup companies that give you both development opportunities, and a chance to work on inspiring projects. So... watch our data science startups review to learn what they do, where to apply, and why you should consider working there. And don’t mind the order – these startups are so unique, that every single one of them could easily be number 1 on our list.

When we measure the occurrences of an event over a certain period of time or distance, we are often left wondering if what we observe is surprising. The Poisson Distribution helps us determine the likelihood of specific discrete outcomes based on a given historical average number of occurrences. For instance, we know that the average firefly lights up 7 times over the course of 20 seconds. With this distribution we can determine the extent to which it will be out of the norm if it lights up only 4 times during that interval. Being able to spot unusual frequencies of recurring events will help us determine whether something is worrisome or not and if we should further investigate the problem.

Let’s have a quick history of development overview: TensorFlow 1 is one of the most widely used deep learning packages. It is very versatile and that is why many practitioners like it. However, it has a major disadvantage – it is very hard to learn and use. This led to the development and popularization of higher-level packages such as PyTorch and Keras. Keras is especially interesting as in 2017 it was integrated in the core TensorFlow – a feat that may sound a bit strange. In reality though, both TensorFlow and Keras are open source, so such things do happen in the programming world. In fact, Keras’ author claims that Keras is conceived as “an interface for TensorFlow rather than a different library”, making this integration even easier to digest and implement. However, even with Keras as a part of TF, TensorFlow was still losing popularity. This was addressed in 2019, when TensorFlow 2.0 came on the horizon. It is TensorFlow’s effort to catch up with the current demand for higher-level programming. Interestingly, instead of creating their own high-level syntax, the TF developers chose to borrow that of Keras. This decision made sense as Keras was widely adopted already and people generally love it. On that note, you may hear people saying: TensorFlow 2 is basically Keras. In fact, TF 2 has the best of both worlds – most of the versatility of TF 1 and the high-level simplicity of Keras. And that’s not all. There are also other major advantages of TF 2 over TF 1. So, if you want to learn more about the advantages of TF 2, make sure to watch the whole video! Enjoy!

It is everywhere we turn and advancing at unprecedented speeds. This has caused the subject to be debated, discussed and analysed at great lengths. Particularly, there are fears that AI has the potential to be a civilization-ending entity. However, as with every theory, there is always an opposing one. Many suggest that AI will, in fact, bring on the beginning of a utopian era: an era where leisure time is in abundance and suffering is at a minimum. It is even conceptualised that humans may one day augment themselves with AI, creating a powerful bond between organic and synthetic life. But what do the EXPERTS think the future will bring? Twenty-seventeen saw two of the biggest tech titans in the world fundamentally disagree on the future of AI. Elon Musk, the visionary CEO of Tesla, Space X, Neuralink, and Open AI, and Mark Zuckerberg, creator and CEO of the social media juggernaut Facebook. While Musk sits on the more pessimistic side of the AI fence with a general message that we should be absolutely terrified of AI, Zuckerberg states that putting regulations in place will slow the advancement of AI, preventing us from utilising its positive benefits such as healthcare, the quest for knowledge, and online and offline security. But is AI really a threat? – Watch this video to find out!

But what do you need to become a data scientist in 2020? Along with this question, you probably want to find out whether your skills are appropriate for this field, what steps you need to take to become a successful data scientist, and if your background will affect the chances of becoming a data scientist. All valid questions! So, to help you answer your questions, we examined 1,001 linked LinkedIn resumes of people who are currently working as data scientists to see where exactly they come from and what skills they’re using in their day-to-day activities. The main messages we extracted from our study both last and this year, is that if you have the skill base that makes a data scientist, you can be a data scientist. It will be interesting to see how the data science profession changes in the next 2-5 years, but right now, a universal data scientist profile appears to be taking shape: a unique programming language toolbox desired across industries and locations; preferably a Master’s degree, or a Bachelor’s and proof of practical abilities; and a confident learning-on-the-go attitude are the currencies of the field. ✅*Special Offer 20% Off*.

An important KPI showing us whether people who buy audiobooks leave reviews. To do that, we’ll need to create a few calculated fields. First, we should create a field, which counts the number of ratings. Not the sum of all ratings, but their count. The next calculated field I would like to create is “Number of purchases”. How do I count the number of purchases? Well, the Transaction ID code is unique, right? If we count it, we would obtain the number of sales transactions, which is precisely what we are looking for. Now we can create the last calculated field, which will be the ratio between reviews and new purchases. Let’s do that. It is a fairly easy task, given that we’ve already created the number of reviews and the number of purchases. All we have to do is divide the two figures, and we’ll obtain the measure we wanted to plot from the very beginning. Let’s add it to the rows of our visualization. The result is a pretty nice bar chart. It appears that the ratio of ratings to new students was significantly lower in November 2017 and way higher the month before. Three times lower to be precise. I am sure the firm’s Business Intelligence team would want to have a look at that and analyze what the reason is for this.

Sounds useful, right? The data we see here is quite meaningful and shows us some important trends, however, actionable decisions will probably have to be made at the audiobook level and will need to be specific for each of the audiobooks our firm sells, addressing the story we see here. Let’s add a filter to chart number two - the pie chart. I’ll simply click on the tiny arrow in its right corner containing more options and will apply “audiobook name” as a filter. Now, when I use the filter, all changes that occur are for the pie chart only. The other two charts remain intact, as the filter we just added has no power over them at the moment. And we want to be able to use this filter in order to modify the entire dashboard and not only one of its charts. How do we do that? Let’s select the tiny arrow in the upper right corner of the filter, and go to “apply to worksheets”, where we will be able to click on selected worksheets. In the dialog box that opens, I can easily add chart 1 and chart 3, and then press Ok. I hope the filter makes changes to all three charts now. And yes. It does. Please, bear in mind the following. If I would like to use some of the chart elements as a filter. All I have to do is select “Use as filter” in the upper right corner of a chart, and then all three charts will be updated. This is another way to play around with filters. Whether we filter data from the actual filter or simply click on a given chart element, it doesn’t make much of a difference. In both cases, a filter will be applied. We’ve constructed a dashboard that can be easily filtered and unfiltered from here. Now we can explore the relationship between different audiobooks, the number of reviews they received, their average score, and the ratio between reviews and audiobook sales.

It will be interesting to put all three charts right next to each other and see the type of insights we can get by analyzing them in one place. To create a new dashboard, I’ll click the tiny icon. When we hover the mouse over it, it starts displaying “New Dashboard”. Once the dashboard has been created, my first task would be to modify its size. Right now, it is a bit too small, isn’t it? I can easily adjust the size settings from the left part of the dashboard screen. Let’s work with a range that is 1,000 pixels wide and has a height of 800 pixels. I hope you are watching this video from a large screen! Ok. Let’s drag and drop the three charts. All I have to do is drag them and place each chart where I want it. Tableau is quite smart and manages to find space and guesses what we want to do when we position the cursor above the dashboard area. Of course, there are a few things that need to be adjusted. I’ll remove the legends we don’t need, leaving the Audiobooks legend only. Moreover, I would like to place the audiobook legend below the pie chart it belongs to. This way, what we are doing will be much clearer. I’ll simply press on the legend and then grab the part you see here, dragging it below the pie chart. Let’s resize a bit to get rid of the arrows. Ok. Great! The arrows disappeared. We are one step closer. Let’s change the chart titles a bit. ….Very well!

The number of reviews is quite important in the marketplace we are studying, and this is the reason why we are interested in finding out which audiobooks collected more reviews. An alternative visualization would be a pie chart showing us the percentage of people who purchased a given audiobook. I’ll add the Rating field to the workspace area. The number we obtained is the sum of all ratings. Let’s use “Count” for this measure. The total number of reviews is 10,798, and we know for a fact that this is true. Let’s go ahead and add the audiobook names dimension above the ratings field, shall we? This creates a breakdown by audiobook. Exactly what we want to have. Now, I can simply select the pie chart icon within the “Show me” functionality and I’ll create a pie chart. To increase the chart’s size, I can simply click anywhere in the workspace area, hold the Control key and then use the arrow keys. If I press Control and Up, the chart grows vertically, while Control and Right arrow increase the chart’s size horizontally. The opposite is true as well, we can decrease the chart’s size by pressing Ctrl and Down key or Ctrl and Left arrow. What else? We need labels, right? Otherwise it is difficult to gain an idea what portion of overall reviews a specific audiobook accounted for. I’ll drag the “Rating” field in “Label” and the number of reviews appears right next to each audiobook (again we need the Count of ratings, and not the Sum). Ok. But how do we display these as a percentage? All I have to do is go to “Analysis”, select “Percentage of”, and then click on “Table”. The pie chart and the labels we added show us that Audiobooks 1 and 2, account for more that 50% of the total number of reviews the company received. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube: ✅https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://365datascience.com/ ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: ✅http://bit.ly/2VZLGfJ Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

Let’s add the date of review information in to columns. And this is where we will be able to see the timing of purchases and reviews. As usual, we are interested in a breakdown by months, so I’ll select “month”. The workspace area shows us that review dates range from February 2017 to February 2018, which is what we expected to see. Let’s insert some data, shall we? First, I’ll add the number of ratings, using the “Count” function. Everything’s fine and we have data for December 2017, so we can forget about that problem. According to our initial plan, this will be a chart that shows the number of reviews and the average review score per month displayed on a secondary axis. So, I’ll add the rating field to rows for the second time, but this time we want the average of these numbers, and we would like to create a dual axis. Obviously, we will have to fine tune the axis scale a bit, as right now the chart doesn’t show match. I’ll simply double-click and choose a fixed range starting from 8 and going all the way up to 10 (which is the maximum review score we can have). Let’s edit its axis. Again, that’s something, which is quite easy to do. We have to double-click on a specific axis and type the axis title we would like to have.

Let’s start with the number of sales transactions first. I’ll simply drag the “measure values” field into the workspace area. 110,570. Precisely what we expected. Good. The number of sales transactions is the one we expected. Next, I’ll remove this field and open the “Audiobook reviews” data to check the number of ratings we have. I’ll simply drag and drop the “Rating” field, but this time Tableau displays an error. It tells us that fields cannot be used from the “Audiobook reviews” data source, because there is no relationship to the primary data source. We find out our data is not blended yet. To do that we have to click on the tiny link icon right next to Transaction ID and choose this to be our linking field. The error we observed previously is not going to appear again because our two data sources are properly linked now. This is a field that shouldn’t be summed but counted as we are interested in the number of ratings left by students and not by the total sum of their ratings. 10,798 – again - the number we expected to see. It’s time for the true test. These numbers were ok the last time too, remember? Let’s plot the number of reviews and the “Date of purchase” field from the “Audiobook” sales file. All I have to do is add “Date of purchase” in columns and then choose a monthly breakdown instead of annual breakdown. Oh, no! December 2017 is empty again! What can we do now?

You can think of a data blend as a specific type of left join that is preferable or necessary to be applied depending on various conditions. Sometimes using a join will do a perfect job, while in other situations blending will either deliver better and quicker results or be the only solution. Moreover, joining data is something you do manually, whereas data blending is a functionality that Tableau implements automatically - while you are working on your sheet. This makes it a more intuitive feature to use, provided that the following condition is met. From a technical perspective, what blending does is take separate query results from each data source and aggregate them in the view, that is in Tableau. Only then it will connect and join the query results on the common field, which should contain information of the same data type. This is different from the case when you are using a join, where the aggregation is happening at the database level, and just the output of the join is being brought back to Tableau. When blending, the aggregation occurs in Tableau. So, what are the benefits of blending data? It turns out that joining or blending can bring different results. And here is the tricky part. If you join two data tables containing duplicate values that are not aggregated properly in while doing some preliminary work on the data, you will obtain an artificially inflated data set in Tableau. Blending solves that problem automatically. Tableau will consider the level of granularity you have chosen in the view, in other words – in your sheet, and will combine the data sources with aggregated fields directly.

Let’s open Sheet 1 and do a few checks. First off, I would like to see how many sale transactions were registered in total. Let’s drag the “number of records” field into the workspace area. Tableau is really quick and tells us that there are 110,570 rows with transaction ID information. These are the actual sales of audiobooks that occurred throughout the entire period of analysis. A quick look into the “sales” Excel file shows us that this number is precisely the one we should have. Next, I’ll test for the number of ratings we have in the Reviews file. I’ll simply drop the ratings field into the workspace area and the result we have is 96,897, which is too high. Why is that? Well, we are summing, not counting. This is the actual sum of all ratings that have been left by students. We want to count the number of ratings instead. Here. That’s much better. People who bought our audiobooks left a total of 10,798 ratings. One final check and we are good to go. Let’s add the “Date of purchase” field to the columns of our work space. Moreover, I’ll increase the level of granularity of our data and will opt for a monthly breakdown. That’s something we can do fairly easily and is one of Tableau’s strongest features. Here’s the monthly breakdown of reviews. Wait. There is something strange. According to Tableau we did not receive any reviews in December 2017. However, I do know for a fact that we did. What happened? Tableau gets confused pretty easily when we join the data and then use a dimension such as “purchase date” from the Sales file, and another field such as “rating” from the reviews file. For some reason, the date fields of the two tables we joined do not match up with each other correctly. Whenever you experience such issues, it is best to use data blending (an alternative to Tableau joins). That’s precisely what we will do in our next lesson.

What we want to obtain is a unique table containing information about all transactions for all audiobooks, and the respective reviews left by clients whenever they chose to do so. The Transaction ID column is the perfect link between the two files, as it is available in both and could serve as a common field based on which we could link the two tables together. So, one of the main aspects we’ll explore in this lesson is how to create a connection between two tables in Tableau. Please remember that we will distinguish the terms ‘data connection’ and ‘table connection’. ‘Table connection’ is performed by functionalities like joining or blending. It refers to combining data from two or more data sources. ‘Data connection’, instead, represents a single data source connection between Tableau and a data source, such as an Excel Workbook or an SQL database. Technically speaking, when creating a join, Tableau sends a query to the database. The join is implemented on the relevant tables at the database level, and the output of the operation is brought back to Tableau, where it is ready to be used for analysis. An inner join means that the two tables we’ve added have a field in common, and we can combine them using that field. Let me hover my mouse over the symbol. Tableau indicates that it has created an inner join using the parameter “audiobook name”. We don’t want that. We want to link the two tables according to the Transaction ID parameter, as our analysis will be focused on user sales and reviews.

To do that, we’ll solve a complete real-life exercise. And each lesson will build up on the previous one. Here’s the Excel data, we’ll use. It was provided by a company that has produced several audiobooks and has been selling them at an online marketplace. One of the main components of that marketplace is reviews, so we have two files – one about sales, and another one containing information about reviews customers left for each audiobook. Both files contain the date when a purchase or a review occurred. It will be great if we manage to produce a table that takes advantage of both types of data we have – when a person bought an audiobook and when and with which rating a person left a review. If we manage to do that, we’ll be able to create several different charts in Tableau that would allow us to learn: • If the number of reviews the company receives has been growing? • How did the average review score change over time? • What is the percentage breakdown between 10-star,9-star, 8-star and other types of reviews? • What percentage of people acquiring an audiobook leave a review? • Visualize the correlation between audiobook sales and number of reviews, or perhaps visualize the correlation between average review score and sales; In the lessons to come, you’ll see how to do all of that!

A chart showing us the number of reviews with a second axis measuring the monthly average score. Then we would like to create a pie chart showing us the percentage of reviews each audiobook obtained (for example 50% Audiobook 1, 25% Audiobook 2, 10% Audiobook 3, and so on …). And finally, we would like to create a chart that gives us information about the ratio between reviews left and the number of audiobook purchases. Such a visualization would help us understand what portion of people buying an audiobook listen to it, and then leave a review. Ok. These three charts will be the foundation of the dashboard we will create later on.

Nevertheless, you are going to want to use all of the data available to you and run analysis on everything together. When we want to perform ‘cross data table joins’ we want to combine two or more data tables to create a unique database. How do we join separate data tables? Well, there are a few ways to do that.

Let's learn how to set up a filter in Tableau to specify the data you want to show. Adding a filter in Tableau is one of the most interesting options available. Of course, we’ll add a filter to our table. From a user’s stand point the only field which makes sense to be filtered in this table is the “Year” field. A person could be interested in seeing numbers for 2016 or 2017 only, for example. So, what I’ll do is select the “Analysis” tab, and then select “Filters”, choosing the “year” field as we had already decided we would like to create a filter for years. And as we do that, a filter appears on the right side of our workspace area. Now, we can easily hide 2017 for example. I’ll simply untick its value and everything related to 2017 disappears from the sheet. Pretty cool, right? Of course, we can do the same with 2016. I’ll select 2017 and untick 2016. We can easily change the filter’s formatting by selecting format filters, or alternatively we change the filter’s title by clicking on the Edit Title button.

Most executives prefer receiving tables that contain totals and subtotals. This makes it easier for them and helps them digest information in a faster way. In this lesson, we will learn how to add subtotals and totals in Tableau. That’s fairly easy to do. I’ll go to “Analysis”, then “Totals” and will select “Show column grand totals”. The totals we just added are for the entire period 2016 and 2017. That’s not really useful, is it? Whenever a person is interested in a company’s sales or gross profit, they want to know how much it made in a specific year, and whether it performed better than the year before. A company will also want to know how its year’s sales compare to other companies. So, I’ll go to “Analysis”, “Totals”, and unclick the “Show column grand totals” to remove the total we just added. What I can do differently the second time around is opt for “add all subtotals”, and this will give me the total figures for 2016 and 2017 separately. Now we can read the table easily. The fictitious numbers we see here help us compare 2016 and 2017, and give us a good idea of what the actual sales were for that period.

Right now, the table we’ve created shows us the number of units sold by the firm in each month of 2016 and 2017. Let’s change this measure. What I would like it to show us is the revenue the company generated during each of these periods. How can I do that? Well, it’s fairly easy. Our source data contains information about price and Tableau counted the number of units sold (each row shows us a single car sale, right?). Therefore, if we multiply the “Price” field and the auto-generated “Number of records” field, we would obtain Revenues. We already know how to create a calculated field. I’ll name it “Revenue”, and will take advantage of Tableau’s auto-complete suggestions multiplying “Price” and “Number of records”. We can use the “star” operator to carry out a multiplication. One very useful feature you have probably noticed, is that at the bottom of the screen Tableau tells us whether the calculation we’ve entered is a valid one or not. Right now, my calculation is valid. If I remove a few symbols, Tableau would indicate that the calculation contains errors. This is a good guiding light when we create a calculation. Right, so this is our “Revenue” field. We can easily substitute the “number of records” data in the table with it. All I have to do is drag the “Revenue field” and position it over the “number of records data”. Tableau replaces the two fields. An important metric contained in our source data is ‘Gross Profit’. By definition, ‘Revenue’ minus ‘Cogs’ equals ‘Gross Profit’. Currently, we have ‘revenue’ and ‘gross profit’. Let’s calculate ‘Cogs’ as the difference between the two. Nice. Let’s order our table in the following way. First, we’ll have Revenue, then Cogs, and finally Gross Profit.

Remember, we shouldn’t go too far with these, as Tableau’s main purpose is visualization, and not data creation or modeling. However, sometimes it can be really handy to perform certain manipulations once we’ve loaded our data into Tableau and we need a certain type of analysis. The typical Tableau operators you’ll need to remember are: + (plus) for addition - (minus) For subtraction, *(star) For multiplication, / (forward slash) for division, And ^ (caret) for elevation. The logical functions available in Tableau are like the ones we have in Excel: AND, OR, and NOT A lot of the functions and symbols used in Excel can be used when creating a calculated field. So, for example, some of the most commonly used functions are SUM (for sum), AVG (for average), MIN and MAX (allowing you to find the minimum and maximum values within a range), and ABS (returning the absolute value of a number). And we already saw the text functions LEFT and RIGHT. They allow us to extract a leftmost and a rightmost number of characters within a string we’ve specified. Besides LEFT and RIGHT, we can also use the typical text functions available in Excel – MID (providing us characters that are in the middle of a text string), UPPER and LOWER (allowing us to either convert it to all uppercase characters or convert it to all lowercase characters).

The table we will create is going to be a pretty simple one, providing a monthly and yearly breakdown of a company’s sales. Our original data source contains a column called “Period”. This is where we have both yearly and monthly data. The first four characters designate the year when a sale was made and then the last two contain information about the month when the sale occurred. What I would like to do is split this information into two separate custom fields – “Year” and “Month”. The way to do that is to go to the ‘Analysis’ tab and create a calculated field. Once this dialog box opens, I’ll type the name of the field I am creating, which is “Year”. Then, I’ll use the LEFT function in order to take the four leftmost symbols of the “Period” field. This is where we have the year when the sale occurred. Tableau recognizes we are writing the LEFT function and it helps us with autocomplete suggestions. The LEFT function needs two arguments from us – a String, which in this case is the “Period” field we have in our source sheet. So, I’ll type “Period”, and as I do that Tableau manages to recognize I’m referring to the “Period” field and allows me to select it right away. The second component of the formula is the number of characters we would like to extract. The other field I would like to create is “month”. And in order to do that, I’ll use the RIGHT function. Again, we’ll need to go to ‘Analysis’, and create a calculated field. First, we’ll assign it with a name – “Months”. And then I’ll type in the RIGHT function, following the exact same procedure as before. Excellent. Now we have our second field – “Months”. Let’s add it right next to years in the workspace area. I can do that in two ways. I can either drag the field into the workspace area and place it right next to the years information, or alternatively drag the “Months” field right next to the “Years” field in the rows part of the screen. The output is the same. Great! We’ve managed to create a nice table that groups all twelve months of 2016 and all twelve months of 2017. I’ll simply insert the auto-generated field “Number of records”, which represents a simple count of the rows we have in our source data. This is a nice table that show us the breakdown of the company’s total number of sales for each month in 2016 and 2017.

As you can see the workspace area is empty right now. We’ve already loaded the GDP data file and we can see that here. The way data is organized here is rather interesting. Our attention should be focused on the ‘dimensions and measures’ part of the screen. First off, we should notice that Tableau has been very smart and managed to organize our data – categorical variables are right here under “dimensions”, while numerical data such as the countries’ actual GDP is under “measures”. “Dimensions” have been colored in blue, and “measures” are in green. Another important remark we have to make is that some of the fields we see here are in italics and others aren’t. The distinction between the two is that Tableau generates certain fields based on the data it finds. When Tableau generates its own fields such as the “Measure names” field we see here, these are fields that are not contained in our original data source, but Tableau deems that these can be useful and creates them for us. The same thing is true for “Latitude”, “Longitude”, “Number of records”, and “Measure values” we see in green under “Measures”. The rest of the fields written without Italics are the ones we saw in the Excel file we loaded – “Country name”, “Indicator name”, and the years from 2002 to 2016, where we have countries’ GDP figures.

So, we’ve already connected our file to Tableau. Now, in this lesson we will get you through the Tableau interface. We will be creating our first sheet. It’s really easy to do and resembles how we create a sheet in Excel or pretty much every other spreadsheet software. All I have to do is click here and a new sheet will be created. If this software is new to you, things can be a bit confusing, so it will be best if we spend a few minutes taking you through Tableau’s interface. First off, we have ten different tabs on Tableau’s default Ribbon. These are File, Data, Worksheet, Dashboard, Story, Analysis, Map, Format, Window, and Help. As with most programs, the File tab contains functionalities related to opening, closing, and saving files. If you would like to, you can also exit Tableau from here, but .. why would you want to do that? Data, on the other hand, is where you will find functionalities related to the data source you are using. Here you can add a new data connection, replace an existing one, or simply edit the data source of the worksheet you are working with. Next, we have the worksheet tab. It can be helpful when we want to create a new worksheet, hide or show a chart’s title, caption, summary, and so on. Ok, next, we have the dashboard and story tabs. The Analysis tab is where you can tweak your visualization in terms of labels, show figures as a percentage of the total, add trend lines, legends, filters and more. ‘Map’ is a tab that is helpful when we use Tableau’s geographic visualization capabilities. Of course, Format can help us adjust the way our visualization appears. From here we can modify its font, font size, axis, backgrounds, labels, size, and so much more ... ‘Windows’ and ‘Help’ are two of the standard tabs we find in most programs, so I am not going to spend much time on them.

First off, we need to learn more about connecting data sources in Tableau. There are two options – we can either create a connection to a file or a server. Of course, we’ll choose one of the two depending on where our data is. Let’s connect Tableau to a Microsoft Excel file.

First, Let’s type Tableau public in Google. If you’re wondering why we searched for “Tableau Public”, the reason is quite trivial. This is Tableau’s free version. If you don’t have a paid subscription for Tableau, this is an excellent alternative. You can practice with most of the program’s functionalities and you don’t have to pay Tableau’s annual fee. So, it is up to you – you can either use Tableau Public for free or pay for Tableau’s desktop version. Both options would allow you to follow along. There are some issues when you want to integrate Tableau Public and programming languages like R, Python, and SQL. To do that, you’ll need Tableau Desktop. But for now, Tableau Public will do just fine and allow us to practice at will. All I have to do here is provide an e-mail address, and once I have done that an ‘exe’ file will download automatically on my computer.

Well, many people are uncertain about the difference between them. And that’s a reasonable doubt, until we point out they serve different purposes. Using Tableau doesn’t necessarily mean you can forget about Excel, and vice versa. Tableau has grown to become one of the most popular business intelligence tools in the entire world. It is a BI software that allows non-technical users to visualize their data and work with it almost immediately, lowering know-how barriers dramatically. In the past, business analysts needed the help of IT personnel who would assist them in gathering raw data and pre-processing it. Only then could business analysts start working on the visualization of such data. The advent of Tableau democratized this process and allowed BI analysts to be independent. Non-technical people can easily load data into the program and start playing with it. Tableau’s forte are meaningful and intuitive visualizations. And sometimes that’s really valuable. Analysts are able to explore their data right away, without spending too much time on numbers which provide limited insights and instead focus on data that matters. This is why we can confidently say that Tableau is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of most corporate business intelligence analysts, data analysts, and data scientists. While Excel is not as powerful or intuitive as Tableau when it comes to data visualization, Tableau is not optimal when you would like to use it as a data creation tool. Although it has several database management functionalities, the program isn’t the best solution when you would like to perform multiple operations with your data before you start analysing it. Moreover, Tableau isn’t great for multi-layered calculations. It is able to calculate its own fields, but it shouldn’t be used as a spreadsheet tool for multi-layered calculations such as the preparation of a budget in Excel. We can agree that a competent analyst needs both Excel and Tableau given that they serve different purposes.

But do matrices? Yes, absolutely. This lesson explains how. In the context of matrices, if you specify dimensions that can’t be filled up by your matrix, R will recycle the vector so your matrix is complete. For example, if I passed the vector from 1 to 10 in the matrix function, and made it explicit that I want my matrix to contain 4 rows and 4 columns, R will recognise that my vector is too short for the matrix, and it will repeat it until all 16 value spots hold a value. As you see, in this particular case, R also issues a warning that 10 is not a multiple of the number of rows, but that isn’t usually consequential. The moral of the story here is: be aware that recycling will happen, if necessary, in some matrix operations.

There are six essential functions we can use to grasp what we’re dealing with. These are the nrow(), ncol(), colnames(), rownames(), str(), and summary(). Nrow() gives us the number of rows our data has, not counting the column names. Respectively, ncol() provides us the number of columns. Colnames() returns the variable names in a data frame. Rownames() is the natural counterpart to colnames(), and returns the observation names in a data frame. Str() gives you the compact version of your data structure. It really comes in handy when you want to have a quick look at your data and how it’s organised. Summary() provides an excellent summary, of the object you pass into it. It is a bit more useful with numerical data, because it provides the essential summary statistics.

It works like this: we pass the data, and then the expression according to which we want or data filtered. There can be more than 1 criteria, of course. Filter() also works with logical operators. The select() function narrows down the data frame to the information you specifically want and need to see. Select() works nicely with a couple of nifty functions like starts_with(), or ends_with(), which let us subset data in a super intuitive way. Mutate() is dplyr’s easy way of creating new variables from variables that already exist in the data frame. For example, if you have height and mass information, you can create a BMI variable. If mutate() is the function to use when you want to add a column to your data frame while also retaining all the other columns in your data frame, then transmute() is what you will opt for if you only want to keep the new variable you create. ✅Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/3b8N6sO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/3a1TosY Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

This video shows how to import a CSV in R (read.csv, read.delim). CSV stands for Comma-separated-value. CSV files are extremely common, so R’s developers have given us the read.csv() short-cut to read them into our sessions. ✅Start your career journey in the data science field & earn a certificate to help you land your dream job: https://365datascience.com/pricing/ read.csv() takes fewer arguments than read.table(), because it’s defaults are set in a very convenient way; headers are TRUE, and sep = ‘,’ Apart from comma-separated, values in a text data file can be separated by tabs; these types of documents are called tab-delimited files. And just as with CSVs, there is a read.table() shortcut to reading them: read.delim(). What’s happening behind the scenes here is that the sep = argument is set to \t, header is again TRUE, and a bunch of other useful arguments are set to default to the most commonly used way. For those of you in Europe or anywhere else in the world where the notation for the decimal is a comma, and therefore CSV files don’t really work for you, there is a read.csv2() function designed to deal with this problem. It reads CSV files with a semi-colon as a separator. The same goes for read.delim()which also has a version 2 with the exact same purpose. ✅Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/34Kd1F7 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/2xv2WiO Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

Let's learn how to create them from scratch (data.frame, str, names). ✅Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 The common limitation of vectors and matrices is that they can only store elements of a single basic type. If we try to assign objects of different kinds to either, R’s coercion takes place. That’s mighty inconvenient for storing any type of real data, which often include both numerical and string variables, as well as, although less often, logical values. Lists are very cumbersome as structures, which makes them extremely difficult to operate on directly. Think of data frames as an Excel spreadsheet: they store different types of data, simultaneously, in a functional way. Data frames combine vectors of the same length into the columns of a table. Data types can differ between columns, but not within columns. That said, a row can be constructed by cells with different data types, but columns can only contain cells of one type. To create a data frame, you need two things: vectors of equal length to bind into the columns of a table, and the data.frame() function. Data.frame binds the vectors as columns and infers that the names of the vector correspond to column names. You can reassign names with the names() function, or do it directly in the initial call.

To save your data into a shareable CSV file, you use write.csv (with a write.csv2 version for those of us who use a comma to denote a decimal). And to save data into a tab-delimited text document, the function to use is write.table. The first argument is the data we want saved. Then, the file name of our saved data must be. This does not have to be identical to the name of the data frame. For everything to work correctly and your file to actually save in CSV format, you’d have to specify that by providing the extension .csv. IMPORTANT: the row.names = argument should be set to FALSE, because if you save a file with the row.names = argument set to TRUE, it will add an extra column in the beginning of the table marking each row from 1 to n, assuming that your actual first column is just the names of the rows. Adding the row.names = argument and setting it to FALSE is going to save you a lot of unnecessary actions. ✅Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/2xgIVg5 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/2yf3hGo Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

It means we will take our data, split it in groups, and then, get collapse all the variables for these groups into one row of whatever type of information we want. By itself, the summarize() function summarizes a data frame in a single result. Group_by() is fairly intuitive. It splits the data frame into individual groups. Then, whatever functions we call to the grouped data frame, they will be executed per group. The group_by() – summarize() combination is one of the most widely used operations in the preliminary stages of data analysis. Sample_n extracts a random sample of a fixed number of rows from your data frame, whereas sample_frac extracts a fixed fraction. ✅Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Connect with us on our social media platforms: Website: https://bit.ly/2wHxHAY Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: https://bit.ly/3cfkeiJ Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

Extracting a value from a matrix happens with square brackets, and the values you want extracted in them. If you’re working with more-dimensional objects, think of R’s extraction schema as looking like this: [ , ]. If we want to extract a row from a matrix, we should type row number, COMMA, and use a blank space to indicate that you want every value on that row. The exact same logic applies to extracting an entire column from a matrix, but this time, the comma precedes the column index. Selecting multiple elements. When talking about vector slicing we learned that we can just pass a vector in the square brackets that indexes the multiple elements we want to extract. The same rule applies to matrices. For example, to select the 1st, 3rd, and 7th rows, all we need to do is open square brackets, pass in a vector of indexes where the rows element is – close the parentheses – comma, and close the square brackets. We can subset matrices using the column names, and row names, too. To extract a named row from a matrix, pass in the name of the row, and leave the space for columns blank.

When it comes to storing data, matrices are a natural extension to vectors: while vectors are 1-dimensional collections of data, matrices are two-dimensional arrays; 2. Matrices have a fixed number of rows and columns; 3. Matrices, same as vectors, can contain only one basic data type. This makes sense: you create a matrix from a vector. You can think of it as curving the vector into rows or columns, and just as a vector can only store doubles, or characters, or logicals, and so on, so can a matrix. There are two methods for creating a matrix in R. The matrix() function, and the rbind() and cbind() functions. matrix() takes at least two arguments: a vector it can structure into a matrix, and an argument specifying the number of rows the new object must have, called nrow. Alternatively, you can pass the number of columns you want your matrix to have, by specifying ncol. When creating the matrix, R fills out the first column first, then moves on to the second, and so on. To organize your data by rows, use the byrow argument in the matrix() function, and set it to TRUE instead of its default FALSE. Using rbind and cbind to create a matrix. Rbind stands for row bind, and cbind for column bind. Naming the components of a matrix is just like naming a vector but instead of the names() function, matrices recognise the colnames() and rownames() functions.

Separators tell R how to look at your data and how to structure the data frame. The header signals whether the first row of the data file is values or variable names. If your data doesn’t have variable names and begins directly with the first observation, then set that argument to FALSE. Finally, the stringsAsFactorsv = argument tells R whether to convert all string variables to factors or not.

What is a spreadsheet? It is an electronic ledger, an electronic version of paper accounting worksheets. It was created to facilitate people who needed to store their accounting information in tabular form digitally. So, it is possible to create tables in a spreadsheet. This is one reason some people believe spreadsheets and databases are interchangeable, while, in reality, they aren’t. There are similarities between the two. Both can contain a large amount of tabular data and can use existing data to make calculations. Third, neither spreadsheets nor databases are typically used by a single person, so many users will work with the data. The differences between the two forms of data storage lie in the way these three characteristics are implemented. Ok. Imagine a spreadsheet. Every cell is treated as a unique entity. It can store any type of information – a date, an integer value, a string name. And then, not only can we have different types of values in various cells, but we can also apply a specific format to these cells. This is not inherent to databases. They contain only raw data. Each cell is a container of a single data value. It is the smallest piece of information there is. You must pre-set the type of data contained in a certain field. This feature prevents inadvertent mistakes – for example, in a field containing date values, should the user try to insert a string, the software will show an error and she will have the chance to correct herself. This won’t happen in Excel – if you insert a string in the column with date values, you wouldn’t obtain an error message, and Excel will store the string value. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube: ✅https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://365datascience.com/ ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: ✅http://bit.ly/2TNunf7 Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “database”? For many people, this question is more challenging than it might seem at first. An answer like “a big file where much information is stored” is not satisfactory and would not please potential employers. You should remember there are two main types of databases – relational and non-relational. Although understanding non-relational databases requires a serious mathematical and programming background, some of the logic applied in its coding is the same as SQL. Likewise, relational databases have a few advantages on their own. A small bit of theory will explain why they are still the preferred choice in many companies and institutions. Databases’ main goal is to organize huge amounts of data that can be quickly retrieved upon users’ request. Therefore, they must be compact, well-structured, and efficient in terms of speed of data extraction. Today, people need such extra efficiency because data occupies memory space and… the bigger its size, the more sluggish the database is and the slower the retrieval process becomes. If we have a database containing one multi-million-row table, with many columns, then every time a request has been received, the server must load all the records, with all fields, and it would take too much time for a task to be completed. Don’t forget every symbol is a container of information and requires bytes of storage space. Hence, loading that much data will not be an easy job for the computer.

Null vs alternative,"👉 Download Our Free Data Science Career Guide:✅https://bit.ly/3fC7rs5 👉 Sign up for Our Complete Data Science Training:✅https://bit.ly/2EMDkl7 In this tutorial we'll introduce hypothesis testing. There are four steps in data-driven decision-making. First, you must formulate a hypothesis. Second, once you have formulated a hypothesis, you will have to find the right test for your hypothesis.Third, you execute the test. And fourth, you make a decision based on the result. Let’s start from the beginning. What is a hypothesis? Though there are many ways to define it, the most intuitive I’ve seen is: “A hypothesis is an idea that can be tested.” This is not the formal definition, but it explains the point very well. So, if I tell you that apples in New York are expensive, this is an idea, or a statement, but is not testable, until I have something to compare it with. For instance, if I define expensive as: any price higher than $1.75 dollars per pound, then it immediately becomes a hypothesis. Alright, what’s something that cannot be a hypothesis? An example may be: would the USA do better or worse under a Clinton administration, compared to a Trump administration? Statistically speaking, this is an idea, but there is no data to test it, therefore it cannot be a hypothesis of a statistical test. Actually, it is more likely to be a topic of another discipline. Conversely, in statistics, we may compare different US presidencies that have already been completed, such as the Obama administration and the Bush administration, as we have data on both. Generally, the researcher is trying to reject the null hypothesis. Think about the null hypothesis as the status quo and the alternative as the change or innovation that challenges that status quo. In our example, Paul was representing the status quo, which we were challenging. *Special Offer 20% Off*. Complete Data Science Online Training Program. Earn a data science degree at your own pace.

Sounds a bit boring, but this will be a fun lecture, I promise! First we will define the problems, and then we will see some interesting examples. Type I error is when you reject a true null hypothesis and is the more serious error. It is also called ‘a false positive’. The probability of making this error is alpha – the level of significance. Since you, the researcher, choose the alpha, the responsibility for making this error lies solely on you. Type II error is when you accept a false null hypothesis. The probability of making this error is denoted by beta. Beta depends mainly on sample size and population variance. So, if your topic is difficult to test due to hard sampling or has high variability, it is more likely to make this type of error. As you can imagine, if the data set is hard to test, it is not your fault, so Type II error is considered a smaller problem. *Special Offer 20% Off*. Complete Data Science Online Training Program.

William Gosset was an English statistician who worked for the brewery of Guinness. He developed different methods for the selection of the best yielding varieties of barley – an important ingredient when making beer. Gosset found big samples tedious, so he was trying to develop a way to extract small samples but still come up with meaningful predictions. He was a curious and productive researcher and published a number of papers that are still relevant today. However, due to the Guinness company policy, he was not allowed to sign the papers with his own name. Therefore, all of his work was under the pen name: Student. Later on, a friend of his and a famous statistician, Ronald Fisher, stepping on the findings of Gosset, introduced the t-statistic, and the name that stuck with the corresponding distribution even today is Student’s t. The Student’s t distribution is one of the biggest breakthroughs in statistics, as it allowed inference through small samples with an unknown population variance. This setting can be applied to a big part of the statistical problems we face today and is an important part of this course. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube: ✅https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1 Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://365datascience.com/ ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience ✅Medium: https://medium.com/@365datascience ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/365datascience/ ✅Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/365datascience ✅Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/365datascienceblog ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ 👇🏻Prepare yourself for a career in data science with our comprehensive program: http://bit.ly/2vaTgJo 👇🏻Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

The statistical term for it is Gaussian distribution, but many people call it the Bell Curve as it is shaped like a bell. It is symmetrical and its mean, median and mode are equal. If you remember the lesson about skewness, you would recognize it has no skew! It is perfectly centered around its mean. Alright. So, it is denoted in this way. N stands for normal, the tilde sign denotes it is a distribution and in brackets we have the mean and the variance of the distribution. On the plane, you can notice that the highest point is located at the mean, because it coincides with the mode. The spread of the graph is determined by the standard deviation. Now, let’s try to understand the normal distribution a little bit better.

In statistics, when we use the term distribution, we usually mean a probability distribution. Good examples are the Normal distribution, the Binomial distribution, and the Uniform distribution. A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. Think about a die. It has six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. We roll the die. What is the probability of getting 1? It is one out of six, so one-sixth, right? What is the probability of getting 2? Once again - one-sixth. The same holds for 3, 4, 5 and 6. Now. What is the probability of getting a 7? It is impossible to get a 7 when rolling a die. Therefore, the probability is 0. The distribution of an event consists not only of the input values that can be observed, but is made up of all possible values. So, the distribution of the event - rolling a die - will be given by the following table. The probability of getting one is 0.17, the probability of getting 2 is 0.17, and so on... you are sure that you have exhausted all possible values when the sum of probabilities is equal to 1% or 100%. For all other values, the probability of occurrence is 0. Each probability distribution is associated with a graph describing the likelihood of occurrence of every event. Here’s the graph for our example. This type of distribution is called a uniform distribution. It is crucial to understand that the distribution is defined by the underlying probabilities and not the graph. The graph is just a visual representation. Alright. Now think about rolling two dice. What are the possibilities? One and one, two and one, one and two, and so on. Here’s a table with all the possible combinations. We are interested in the sum of the two dice. So, what’s the probability of getting a sum of 1? It’s 0, as this event is impossible. What’s the probability of getting a sum of 2? There is only one combination that would give us a sum of 2 – when both dice are equal to 1. So, 1 out of 36 total outcomes, or 0.03. Similarly, the probability of getting a sum of 3 is given by the number of combinations that give a sum of three divided by 36. Therefore, 2 divided by 36, or 0.06. We continue this way until we have the full probability distribution.

Skewness indicates whether the observations in a data set are concentrated on one side. Why is skewness important? Skewness tells us a lot about where the data is situated. The mean, median and mode should be used together to get a good understanding of the dataset. Measures of asymmetry like skewness are the link between central tendency measures and probability theory, which ultimately allows us to get a more complete understanding of the data we are working with.

Even if you are familiar with these terms, please stick around, as we will explore their upsides and shortfalls. The first measure we will study is the mean, also known as the simple average. It is denoted by the Greek letter mu for a population and x bar for a sample. These notions will come in handy in the next section. We can find the mean of a data set by adding up all of its components and then dividing them by the number of components contained in the data set. The mean is the most common measure of central tendency but it has a huge downside – it is easily affected by outliers So, how can we protect ourselves from this issue? You guessed it, we can calculate the second measure – the median. The median is basically the ‘middle’ number in an ordered data set. Finally, the mode is the value that occurs most often. It can be used for both numerical and categorical data. 👇🏻Follow us on YouTube: ✅https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience 👇🏻Connect with us on our social media platforms: ✅Website: https://bit.ly/34vg6bM ✅Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/365datascience ✅Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/365datascience ✅Q&A Hub: https://365datascience.com/qa-hub/ ✅LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience Get in touch about the training at: support@365datascience.com Comment, like, share, and subscribe!

They are very intuitive, so don’t worry. Qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal. Nominal variables are like the categories we talked about just now – Mercedes, BMW or Audi, or like the four seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn. They aren’t numbers and cannot be put in any order. Ordinal data, on the other hand, consists of groups and categories but follows a strict order. Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are: disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, and delicious. Although we have words and not numbers, it is obvious that these preferences are ordered from negative to positive, thus the data is qualitative, ordinal. Okay, so what about quantitative variables? Well, as you may have guessed by now, they are also split into two groups: interval and ratio. Intervals and ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference. Ratios have a true zero and intervals don’t. For example, length is a ratio variable. You all know that 0 inches or 0 feet means that there is no length. With temperature, however, we have a different story. It is usually an interval variable. Let me explain. Usually, it is expressed in Celsius or Fahrenheit. They are both interval variables. 0 degrees Celsius or 0 degrees Fahrenheit don’t not mean anything, as the absolute zero temperature is actually -273.15 degrees Celsius, or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit. However, we can easily say that 80 degrees Fahrenheit is less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the case of interval variables, the difference is meaningful, but the 0 is not. Continuing this temperature example, there is another scale – Kelvin’s. According to it, the absolute minimum temperature is 0 degrees Kelvin. Therefore, if the degrees are stated in Kelvin’s the variable will be a ratio. So. Numbers like 2, 3, 10, 10.5, Pi, etc. can be both interval or ratio, but you have to be careful with the context you are operating in. Alright!
