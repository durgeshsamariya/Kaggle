I liked your code for extracting table data from multiple web pages and creating and pasting it in respective worksheets - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbOdUaf4yfI However my task is a bit different which is the following: 1) There are several (100s or 1000s) web-links in column A. 2) A connection is established with a web-link's webpage. 3) On the connected webpage, the first HREF link that contains the text ""About"" is copied and it's web-link is pasted in the adjacent cell in column B. If ""About"" HREF link is not found on connected webpage, then the cell is populated with ""NOT FOUND"". 4) The connection is closed and steps 1 - 3 are repeated until there are no more web-links in column A. Some examples we can try with are the following web-links in column A: Column A Column B 1) https://www.google.com/ https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/ 2) https://www.facebook.com/ https://www.facebook.com/facebook 3) http://www.youtube.com/ http://www.youtube.com/yt/about/ 4) http://www.yahoo.com/ http://info.yahoo.com/ 5) http://www.wikipedia.org/ NOT FOUND 6) http://www.linkedin.com/ http://www.linkedin.com/about-us Note: 1) When a respective ""About"" HREF link is copied from the webpage of a web-link in Column A, and the same is pasted in Column B, the web-link of the ""About"" HREF link is displayed in Column B. 2) ""About"" HREF links on webpages can be one of several variations like - About, About Us, About ""Company_Name"", etc. Whatever it is, we want to capture the first HREF link that contains the text - ""About"".

But how do you get data from a web page which has a difficult form with a button that has no id or name property? You need to adapt your VBA code to do the job.

But the number in cell should not be deleted (i.e. 1001) Now in sheet2 again in cell A7 I give 1003 then in sheet1 the entire row from Item to Price should become blank. But the number in cell should not be deleted (i.e. 1007) Looking out for the solution for this. Tried a lot but unable to do it. If you write a macro in a specific sheet, say sheet1, then you may have a problem running the code because in this case you also need to access sheet2. Therefore you need a stand alone module. First we find out which code the user enters in a worksheet2 and capture it in a variable. Next we go to sheet one and loop through its data and compare the code numbers with the code number captured in the variable 'num'. If we find the code we then select the appropriate row and columns and delete the specific data like for example in columns 2 to 5. Here we combine the interesting property of the 'Range' and the 'cells property' to access the correct column and row range. Once the data is accessed we can then clear the contents only of those cells in a specific manner. Once you study the video you'll realize that it has covered many interesting aspects of Excel VBA.

Of course, you can do multiple things like copying and pasting in another worksheet in the looping process. You use the do while loop when you know the starting point but are not sure of the last data entry point. Therefore you need to define a starting point, a condition that must be met for the loop to perform its job and an increment in the value of the initialized point or starting point like a row or column value. Looping processes are important for any kind of automation. Another looping form is the 'for next' loop that works very efficiently if you know the starting and end points like for example at which row you wish to start the calculations and which row you wish to end the process.",27,Education,PT12M20S,740,2d,sd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yDid3IKmcUE/maxresdefault.jpg,1,71866,308,13,0,45

But how do we fill a listbox on Excel userform with unique values from a worksheet? We use a 'collection' object. A collection can hold a lot of data in one variable. It has four methods and the Add method looks like this Collection.Add item, [key], [before], [after] The key value has to be unique. Now you assign the same value to the key and the item. So no duplicate values can be added. Every time VBA encounters a duplicate value it generates an error. We choose to ignore the errors by using 'On error resume next' line of code and achieve our goal of not adding any duplicate values to our listbox. Important thing to notice is that you convert the key value into a string.

Excel VBA provides an elegant solution. First we define a few variables that can count the rows and columns so that we know how many cells are in use in the Excel worksheets. Next we assign the used ranges to the sheet with the maximum values. Now using a nested 'for loop' we access each cell in the used range and compare them. If the cells values are not equal we write them into a new workbook and also count the difference so that we tell the user about the number of cells that were not the same and also display both the values in the compared sheets. The displayed values are in the same cells in the new workbook as they appeared in the compared worksheets and highlighted appropriately. We also use a command button so that the user can perform the task with a single click!

When the user enters such text shortcuts we need to convert that data into the full form that everybody can understand. Therefore we have to use Excel VBA for such conversions or translations. The process of writing the macro code in VBA may look difficult at first sight but if you study the problem and the solution, you find that understanding the code is not difficult. 1. We first extract the text part from the user's entry using a 'for loop' 2.

It does this because the calculator already *knows* I want 12 M&Ms, I only have 6 red and 3 blue, and automatically completes the cart. Also you can tell that it removed 7 - 12 because clearly I can't select those if I only want 12 M&Ms. Ex2: Select the packaging you want your M&Ms to be in: Standard, Box, or Wrapping If I select ""Box"" it automatically will add a $5 charge to a list that will eventually add everything up and produce a total. So even though it says ""Box"" as the clickable button, the simple calculator knows Box = $5. Is it difficult to make something like that? I appreciate any tips you can give me. Thank you for your time.' Based on this question we have designed a userform with labels, list-box, textboxes, option buttons and a command button.

Today we compare the loan amortization method with an 'intuitive' method to perform the refinance home loan calculations quicker and easier. We can calculate the equal monthly payments on a home loan if we have the loan amount, interest rate per year and the period of the loan using the straight-forward PMT function. Now we can draw a time line between 0 and let's say 180 months because the loan is for 15 years and payments are made monthly. If we imagine that we are standing at 0 (our decision point) and looking at 180 our future value at month 180 will be our present loan amount i.e. 80% of $400000. Now since Lisa has paid her 60th instalment and we look again forward we'll find that we are standing at 120 payments away from the final payment at 180. Also 180 minus 60 gives us 120, isn't it? Using the PV function in Excel we can calculate the balance amount at point 61 or beginning of the 61st payment. For refinancing calculations we can use this amount as the starting loan for the new finance option and calculate the equal monthly instalments (EMIs) or equal monthly payments. Based on the difference of what we would have paid at 8% interest rate per annum and the new interest rate per annum of 7% in the new option we can find our savings or loss. Now the gain in this case will be for the next 120 months or 10 years. We can calculate the present value of the 120 instalments using the PV function again to find the total gain in today's $ value. Since Lisa would have to pay $50 every month as transaction fees for the next 120 months or 10 years, we need to calculate its present value and subtract it from the earlier gain to arrive at the 'ACTUAL' gain in today's $ terms. Our final result is $7024 and this should be the correct answer for Susan.",27,Education,PT13M47S,827,2d,sd,FALSE,,1,5150,8,0,0,2

So if you wish to calculate the monthly payments for your employees you need to have a start time, an end time and the payments per hour. Whether the person works during day-shifts or night-shifts, Excel can help make the calculations easy and automatic. Just ensure that you enter time in the format x:y:z, where x = hours, y=minutes and z=seconds if you wish to have seconds in your data else just use x:y, i. e. hours and minutes separated by ':' (colon). If you want enter time as 'am' or 'pm' just add a 'p' after the time. If you don't write anything after the hours, minutes and seconds MS-Excel assumes it is 'am'. If you use the '24-hour' clock, Excel has no problems with 'am' or 'pm'.

""Steamliner, Inc. has a project that it expects will produce a cash flow of $4.5 million in 10 years. To finance the project, the company needs to borrow $1.5 million today. The project will produce intermediate cash flows of $125,000 per year that the company can use to service annual coupon payments. The firm's underwriter suggests that the market would be receptive to a 10-year bond with a face value of $2 million with a $125,000 annual coupon (paid at the rate of $62,500 every six months). Alternatively, Steamliner has the option to raise the $1.5 million by issuing 10-year zero coupon bonds with a face value of $3.5 million. What is the annualized yield to maturity (YTM) on the preferred option? (Recall that the compounding interval is 6 months and the YTM, like all interest rates, is reported on an annualized basis.)"" MS Excel is the ideal tool to solve such finance problems but the most important thing is creating a time-line and understanding the problem thoroughly. In our case the time line of 10 years is divided into 20 periods. In the zero-period we have the inintial money and in the following periods we have the 'coupons'. Now we use the 'RATE' function in Excel to calculate the Yield To Maturity or YTM using the 20 periods. Since our results will reflect the semi-annualized values we need to multiply the result by 2 to get the correct annualized amounts. Another option is to write the data properly and use the IRR function. Yet another method to calculate the YTM is to divide the 3.5M by 1.5M and then raise the result to the power '1/20' to get the interest rate per 6 months by subtracting 1 and then multiplying by 100. You get the final result by multiplying by 2 for annualized values. Quite useful way! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBQI0RZqc4o",27,Education,PT9M50S,590,2d,sd,FALSE,,1,6408,7,0,0,0

The par (face) value of the bond is $1,000,000. Recently, however, the company has run into some financial difficulty and has restructured its obligations.Today's coupon payment has already been paid, but the remaining coupon payments will be postponed until maturity. The postponed payments will accrue interest at an annual rate of 5% per year and will be paid as a lump sum amount at maturity along with the face value. The discount rate on the renegotiated bonds, now considered much riskier, has gone from 7% prior to the renegotiations to 15% per annum with the announcement of the restructuring. What is the price at which the new renegotiated bond should be selling today? (Recall that the compounding interval is 6 months and the YTM, like all interest rates, is reported on an annualized basis.)"" 1. We create a proper time-line for 10 years divided into 20 periods because of the 6-months nature of coupons 2.

Please help!!!!! ""Walmart is considering opening a small experimental store in New York city. A store is expected to have a long economic life, but the valuation horizon is 10 years. The store in New York is likely to generate revenues of $33M in the first year and then it grows at 5%. but the costs of running the business is high because the margins on all the products sold are low (it is a volume business!) The cost of goods sold are $12M in year 1 and they are expected to grow at 4% per year thereafter. Selling and administration costs are likely to be $1M every year as it is a small store. The tax rate is 35%. Walmart is so good at managing its stores that working capital increases can be assumed to be negligible. But since New York city is an expensive place, Walmart will have to invest $200 million in purchasing a building (with land) even though it is a much smaller property than a usual Walmart store. The good news is that this outlay can be depreciated straight line over 10 years. Also, Walmart has estimated that the terminal value in year 10 dollars is $100 million. This value is the value of all cash flows in year 11 and beyond. Should Walmart undertake this project? Hint: Calculate the NPV or Net Present Value of the project if the discount rate is 5%."" George We solve George's problem in MS Excel by first calculating the total Revenues, Cost of goods sold, Selling and Admin expenses and depreciation. Now we subtract COGS, Selling and Admin costs and depreciation from the revenues to get our profits after depreciation. Next we deduct taxes from our profits after depreciation to get our profits after depreciation and tax. Now we add back the depreciation to the calculated profits and get our true cash flows. We then calculate the present value of our cash flows for the 10 years. To calculate the NPV or Net Present Value we subtract the initial investment of 200 million dollars to the present value of the sum of cash flows and also add the present value of the 'terminal' amount. Since the NPV is a high positive value we can now say that Walmart can go ahead with the project. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJbfvaSx8xY",27,Education,PT9M45S,585,2d,sd,FALSE,,1,17217,27,0,0,7

The concepts of class and objcts is not difficult to understand. Just take some time to study the concept carefully. Here is the user's problem: I'm entering data about employees in my company in Excel. Things like EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, etc. I wish to be warned if I enter a duplicate ID. Also such duplicate entry should not be entered. Is it possible to do something like this in MS-Excel? In VBA a class is defined in class module and serves as a template or blue-print for an object. You can create an object from a class. A class consumes no memory. A class is defined by its properties which describe the attributes of the class and its methods which carry out the actions in the object. Example of a class: clsEmployees. An employee can have attributes or properties such as First Name, Last Name, Date of birth, Date of joining, Salary, etc. How to create an object of the class? When you create an instance of a class with the 'New' keyword, a process called instantiating, it becomes an object. An object consumes memory and can carry out actions. An example of instantiation or object creation for our class clsEmployees is shown below: Dim recEmployee as clsEmployee Set recEmployee = New clsEmployee It is possible to combine the two statements above into a single statement: Dim recEmployee As New clsEmployee Storing Multiple Objects in a collection: If you need to store multiple instances of a class such as for a group of employees, you can create multiple objects from the class and store them in a Collection or Dictionary object as shown below: Dim colEmployees As Collection Set colEmployees = New Collection Again it is possible to combine the two statements above into a single statement: Dim colEmployees As New Collection Now let's write two sub-routines that provide a solution.

I've received many emails lately about how to use solver in Excel. Let's take an example of a training institute. Depending on the number of students per month and the average fees that it charges, we can calculate the annual income. Similarly we can compute the annual expenses. Now the annual profit before taxes and depreciation will be equal to the income minus the expenses. The institute owner is not happy. He wishes his income to be 1000000. To do that he has to get more students and/or decrease his expenses. Of course, he cannot have unlimited number of students and he cannot reduce his expenses to zero. So he has to work within certain constraints. Using these details we can ask solver to provide a solution. So our target cell is the profit in cell b3. Our profit dpends on the number of students in cells e3 to e14. They cannot be unlimited and they cannot be fractions. Our profit also depends on the fees that we charge and we cannot charge what we like but as per market conditions. The average fee is in cells F3 to F15. Our profit also depend on how we control our expenses. Here also we face constraints. So we can reduce our expenses only upto to a certain extent. Therefore we need to provide Solver with some constraints so that it can help us to find a good solution. Now let's see how we can solve the problem and learn how to use the basics of Solver in Excel.",27,Education,PT8M47S,527,2d,sd,FALSE,,1,5311,8,1,0,0
