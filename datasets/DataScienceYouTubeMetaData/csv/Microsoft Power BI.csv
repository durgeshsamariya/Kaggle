The other important cornerstone is intelligently identifying and handling errors as they occur during scheduled refreshes. Primary topics for error handling include: replacing vs removing errors, collecting error metadata, and configuring the refresh to either fail or refresh successfully when errors occur.

It's included with Power BI Premium so you have the ability to move to the cloud on your terms. In this week's webinar the Report Server team will answer your questions AND show you the answers live. Don't have any questions? Not to worry we will have the team pull out their favorite demo and show why you should start using Microsoft Report Server now. About our host Chris Finlan: Since its introduction in 2013, Christopher Finlan has been one of the top evangelists for Power BI in his role at Microsoft. As the lead Business Intelligence Technology Solution resource in the Mid-Atlantic Region, he was responsible for helping over 140 enterprise customers align their specific requirements to the Microsoft Cloud and Data Platform. His unique presentation style and background in “shadow IT” has made him a highly sought-after speaker for customer presentations from the server room to the board room on a wide variety of BI-related topics. Prior to joining Microsoft, Chris led the transition for his team to a fast and flexible reporting and LOB solution that integrated Microsoft Technology with SAP Data. By creating and implementing customized mobile and desktop applications that supported hundreds of internal users across diverse lines of business, he saw first-hand how Microsoft’s tools could transform a business in record time and generate millions of dollars of savings from lost productivity and wasted investments in technology that had ten times the cost while providing a fraction of the value. He spoke about some of that experience during his appearance on the popular .Net Rocks! internet talk show. Currently a Senior Program Manager on the Power BI team, Chris has been working in the software industry in various roles, from the product team to pre-sales, technical training, database administration and sales operations. He holds a B.A. from Temple University in Philadelphia. Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/mspowerbi More questions?

Each game pushes and explores different boundaries in DAX and will attempt to show just where those lines are.

In any organization, there is a need to analyze the text data such as customer comments, extract the primary purpose of a call from its scripts, detect the language of customer feedback and translate it and so forth. To address this issue, Microsoft Cognitive Services provides a set of APIs, SDKs, and services available to developers to do text analysis without writing R or Python codes. In this session, I will explain what is text analysis such as sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, Language detection and so forth. Next, the process of text analysis in Power BI using cognitive services will be demonstrated. Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/mspowerbi More questions?
