(By a Data Scientist),In this video I walk you through some of the specifics of the YouTube Algorithm. My background as a data scientist can help you better understand this algorithm and increase your chances of having it pick your videos up. The algorithm wants you to watch YouTube for as long as possible. It prioritizes videos that have a high click through rate (CTR) and high watch time. When you combine these two metrics you get Expected watch time. This is the variable that the algorithm is trying to optimize for with each recommendation. Jarvis Johnson Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GYXemlyd_Q YouTube Algo White Paper: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf More on the Algo: https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/02/16/youtube-algorithm-reverse-engineering-part-ii/ Another good Algo Resource: https://ammar-alyousfi.com/2020/youtube-trending-videos-analysis-2019-us The model uses a two phased deep neural net architecture. The first phase takes millions of videos and filters them to less than 1000 relevant videos. The next phase ranks the smaller group of videos based on more specific metrics that youtube has access to. Take aways for growth: 1) Maximize Expected Watch time 2) Give viewers a reason to watch to the end 3) Make videos similar to others in a specific domain 4) Optimize videos for the 3rd day 5) Tweak things periodically to capitalize on A/B testing #DataScience #KenJee #YouTubeAlgorithm Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 47% Discount on 365 Data Science (Affiliate Link): https://365datascience.pxf.io/Z7gXQ More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Keyboard: https://amzn.to/2YdxEGz Mouse: https://amzn.to/30kMJZH Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

Special thanks to him for submitting his work! Shivam is very active on github which is a good thing. Still, his github profile could use some maintenance. He has some repos that are empty and should be deleted. He could also benefit from improved naming conventions and project descriptions. One of my favorite projects that he does is he coded a Nerual Net from scratch. This is an awesome project that shows his genuine interest in how the data science models work. This isn't something that I look for, but it is definitely a positive to have. This isn't a data science project that would supplement for one done with actual data, but it is still very strong. For Shivam, I recommend that he build a portfolio website to showcase specific projects or use a github profile header like Import Data shows in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_RDoNJ1zGg Machine learning projects I recommend doing: At least 1 on regression, classification, clustering.

I talk about the hardware components of a computer and how those relate to your data science performance. At the end, I give my thoughts on the best computer for you to purchase. The cpu is in charge of the processing power of the computer. It mostly controls how fast processing for normal data science operations is. The ram stands for random access memory. It determines how much data can be processed in a single batch. You will also need a hard drive. I recommend stead state memory. This doesn't have much impact on performance of your models, so you don't need to go crazy here. This is the cheapest type of memory though so you can scale up at a low cost. The last main component that is relevant for data science is the GPU. NVIDIA recently sent me a Titan RTX, and I am excited to be experimenting with that in future videos. For deep learning, you should really have at least 6 gb of gpu memory. If you are playing graphics intensive games or editing videos, I recommend increasing this further. My final recommendation: Your computer really doesn't matter much. Data science is done mostly on the cloud making your computer relatively irrelevant. You have access to top of the line GPU's and even TPU's on kaggle.com or through google colab. In my opinion, the best computer for data science is the one that you can afford. If you still want to do something locally, I recommend the following requirements CPU (4 cores): Ryzen 5, 7, 9 should suffice Ram: Minimum 8gb but 16 is preferred HD: 256gb GPU: NVIDIA with 6+ GB of memory (4 + gb if if laptop) My laptop: https://amzn.to/2W3Zh4E Budget PC Parts CPU: Ryzen 5 ($150) https://amzn.to/38MaLPp RAM: Corsair 16gb ($75) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV HD: WD SSD 480 GB ($55) https://amzn.to/3fgdUcR GPU: GTX 1660 ($230) https://amzn.to/3iNaUqx Total: $510 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200) Mid Tier PC Parts CPU: Ryzen 7 ($284) https://amzn.to/2Ci9IuC RAM: Corsair 32gb ($150) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV HD: WD SSD 480 GB ($55) https://amzn.to/3fgdUcR GPU: RTX 2070 ($640) https://amzn.to/3iLwiwg Total: $1129 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200) High Tier PC Parts CPU: Ryzen 9 ($423) https://amzn.to/2BN2bUN RAM: Corsair 32gb ($150) https://amzn.to/38FfiTV HD: SAMSUNG SSD 1 TB ($179) https://amzn.to/3egXakr GPU: Titan RTX ($2500) https://amzn.to/2ZbELBc (borderline overkill) Total: $3252 (before case, motherboard & power supply ~$200) If you do decide to build a pc, I recommend using https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ to make sure your parts are all compatible! #DataScience #KenJee #SportsAnalytics Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 47% Discount on 365 Data Science (Affiliate Link): https://365datascience.pxf.io/Z7gXQ More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Keyboard: https://amzn.to/2YdxEGz Mouse: https://amzn.to/30kMJZH Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

This is one of the most frequent questions that I get. Hopefully this will shed some light on your path and give you a concrete starting point. Unfortunately, everyone learns data science a little differently. What works for me may not work for you. It matters less where you start learning and more when. You should start right now and choose a course, certificate or project. Just do it. Most of the resources out there are very good, and you won't notice a difference as you learn more. Once thing people don't realize is that learning data science is additive. If you want to take multiple courses, go ahead! No one learns data science from a single source. I have learned data science concepts from my schoolwork, projects, certificates, other people, etc. You shouldn't think one certificate will teach you everything. Again, these are my best tips on where to start learning data science!

I also give you some tips on how to prepare for these internships as a whole. First, I recommend just applying. A bias towards action helps you to figure out the areas that you need to work on. I also think you should have at least a foundation in programming either using python or R. You also should have taken at least an intro to stats course. If you want to put your best foot forward, you should be familiar with the 3 main types of data science algorithms: Regression, Classification, and Clustering. I also recommend that you do some projects to solidify these skills. These are some beginner projects that I recommend doing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8qZafpo Finally, it isn't the end of the world to not get a data science or machine learning internship.

In this phase, we try multiple different data science algorithms to see which one performs the best. We tune each of these algorithms, and often try multiple at a time to see if we can produce a more accurate result. Here, I try a multiple linear regression, a lasso regression, and a random forest regressor. I chose to do a lasso regression because the data is fairly sparse, and we would expect a normalized model to perform better. I also selected a random forest because we had many dummy variables. With this type of data, we would also expect a tree based model to perform well. Please stay tuned for part 6 where we productionize this model.

It where we start analyzing trends and begin to find insights. First, I do some additional data cleaning. I clean up the job titles, and do some feature engineering. Next, I look at histograms and box plots of the continuous data fields. This is an important step because we want normal data if we plan to do a regression analysis. We then look at the categorical data. We want to see what companies, states, industries, and sectors these jobs are offered in. After that, we make some pivot tables to better understand how average salary is different across our categorical categories. Finally, we make a word cloud to visualize some of the most common words found in the descriptions. Please stay tuned for part 5 where we start building models to predict salary!

Python has some handy functions that allow you to parse and replace data relatively easily. You can also use regular expressions to do this; however, those are a bit beyond the scope of this video. I mostly use lambda functions because I think that this is the simplest approach. The first thing that we clean is the data science salary. We need to make sure that it is numeric because we are using that as our dependent variable. We also want to go through and do some light feature engineering. We can get some info about the state of the job postings and the nature of the job postings themselves. I went through and looked to see if the postings had python, r-studio, spark, aws, or excel listed and added those as features. Again, this is an iterative approach that is rather messy. Please stay tuned for part 4 of the series EDA!

You should search github to see if someone has already built a web scraper for the website you are looking at. You should also check to see if the website has an open API. For this project, I found someone who had written a glassdoor web scraper and I was able to version it for our purposes. The code and the article that I used are linked here: Code: https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium Article: https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905 This web scraper was written in python with the selinium package. This is an iterative process, so in this video you will see how I go about debugging my code and making it work. Stay tuned for part 3 where I go through and clean up the data that we collected to make it usable for our EDA and model building. After we scrape the data, I save the code to github.

In this video I go through the planning and idea creation for this new data science project. I have gotten quite a few requests to do data science project from scratch. I also left these series mostly unedited so you can see me get stuck and how I figure out the path forward. The next phases of the project are, data collection, data cleaning, eda, model building, and productionzation. For data science project ideation, you generally have two approaches. You can look through available data on kaggle or google data, or you can come up with an idea and then go out and find your data. In this video, I show you how to do both approaches. I end up choosing a data science project based on a simple whiteboarding session. We will try to predict data science salaries based on data scraped from glassdoor or linkedin. In part 2 I will show you how to scrape your data and how to set up a github repo.

I get many of the examples from the book ""Weapons of Math Destruction"" by Cathy O'Neil. Book: https://amzn.to/2w1eJVy Even well intentioned data science models can have negative consequences. Take the college ranking system for example. This system was designed to evaluate the quality of schools, and evaluated them across a host of different metrics. One thing that was not considered was the cost of attendance. Universities spent billions of dollars to improve their rankings, and this was reflected in tuition rates. This model lacked an extremely important input and thus caused a major incentive problem. Another example is social media. Companies are doing their best to keep you on their platforms with notifications, likes, etc. This can have an addictive impact as well. The algorithms are doing their job, but we are getting addicted to our phones and devices. A third example comes from the news. News companies want as much interaction with their articles as possible. Unfortunately, the articles that get the most engagement are the ones that are controversial and sensationalist. These machine learning models promote these types of articles because that its what they are trained to do. It is our responsibility as data scientists to make sure our models are used for good and don't have negative unintended consequences. You can do this by getting user feedback, re-training and evaluating, and testing your models continuously on real world data.

This learning philosophy is based off of Scott Young's book ultralearning (linked below). Scott used this approach to learn the entire undergrad MIT Computer Science curriculum in a single year (and pass all the exams). Ultralearning has 9 principles and I show you how you can apply many of them to data science. Ultralearning Book: https://amzn.to/33LTvYf *This is an amazon affiliate link. The couple cents I get from your purchase go to paying off my student loans, so buying is greatly appreciated! This is at no cost to you! Principle 1: Metalearning - Plan your learning journey. Think about your data science goal and create a roadmap to get here. This should take up to 10% of your total learning time. If you want to become a data scientist, you need to learn programming and math. Figure out exactly what concepts you need to know from each disciplines. For learning Coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN12ZPFsApM For learning Math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSwM5uVeylU Principle 2: Focus - To stick to your data science learning plan, you should train yourself to focus. This is a learned skill. You should pay careful attention to your environment and schedule your time wisely. Video on data science focus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akbU9KOo_Qc Principle 3: Directness - This is my favorite one. If you want to learn data science, you should do data science. You will quickly find out where you are weakest. You should then work on these things. Video on projects for your portfolio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yukdXV9LR48 Where to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq5TnVJWv6A Beginner Projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8qZafpo Project Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy-R4oUZaC8 Principle 4: Like Principle 5: Subscribe Principle 6: Feedback - to maximize your data science performance, you need to focus on feedback loops. Programming is great because you have immediate feedback from error messages. I also recommend reaching out to your friends who are data scientists or people in your network to get feedback on your projects. I also am happy to give resume or project feedback, but please watch all my relevant videos first. Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ARnFpk83JauioZb5zyxNZek Principle 9: Exploration - You need to keep learning because data science is constantly changing. #DataScience #KenJee Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

Right now the world is going through a period of change. It has been disrupted by illness, and will likely not return to how it was before. While it is a scary time, this can also be a great opportunity to reflect and to improve yourself. Reason 1: You likely have more time than ever to learn data science. With social distancing your leisure time is changing. Most people likely will have to spend more time inside and you might as well use that time to learn data science or programming. Reason 2: The culture of work will begin to shift. Generally, work from home will become more accepted in the workplace. If you have technical skills programming, data science, etc. you will be well equipped to deal with the new job market. Reason 3: People are relying heavily on quantitative information. #DataScience #KenJee #LearnDataScience Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

This is the type of project that you could put in your portfolio or on your resume. I have been asked quite a bit to do an end-to-end data science project. This is a simple project that leverages deep learning for image classification. Data science projects don't all have to be overwhelmingly difficult and take a tremendous amount of time. Something like this, that produces a good solution to an interesting problem are just as valuable. For this project I use google collab and fastai for the deep learning portion. These tools make it easy to do a deep learning project and get dependable results. fastai is built on top of pytorch, and abstracts away many of the overly complex parts of deep learning. I highly recommend their free MOOC, linked below. In this project, we use a convolutional neural net (CNN), that was trained on the resnet dataset. With this, we can use transfer learning to produce a good result with little additional training. github repo: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier fastai course repo: https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb fastai course: https://www.fast.ai/ fatkun plugin for image downloads: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en #DataScience #KenJee #SportsAnalytics #DataScienceProject Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

I hope that revealing this will make data science seem less intimidating and will help you on your learning journey. Remember to subscribe! https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 Fro my experience working in data science, every data scientist is constantly referencing outside resources. This can be stack overflow, google, code docs, past code etc. Very little data science is done by sitting in front of a computer and just coding. Data science is iterative and little of it comes directly from your brain to the computer. Great data scientists aren't the best coders or the best at math, they are the people that know where to look for information and apply it the most effectively. It may be a little disappointing, but even at the lowest levels of data science you can begin to understand how to search for the data that you want. Many data scientists also will have a source code document that they refer to on almost all of their projects. This saves them time and effort so they can focus on the real problem solving.

I will talk about my data science journey and how I ""leveled up"" from one stage to the next. Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 Stage 1: Unconscious Incompetence (Novice Data Scientist) - In this stage the field may seem relatively easy. After watching some youtube videos and learning some python or r basics, you will learn how large the field of data science is. Free data science course recommendations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4 Stage 2: Conscious Incompetence (Overwhelmed) - In this stage you will begin to understand the different elements of programming and statistics. Most people get stuck here because they don't know where to start. To get to the next stage, you should narrow the boundaries and start with a small data science project. Learn the necessary skills to complete that task, then move on to another small one. You should also go on kaggle and review code of other data scientists. Keep a log of all the terms, algorithms, and packages that you don't know. Stage 3: Conscious Competence (Slightly Dangerous) - Here you will have had a few projects under your belt. You will now be able to reuse your python or r code. This is where you truly learn data science. You should do as many projects as you can and learn to code data science algorithms from scratch. Stage 4: Unconscious Competence (Art Form) - At this stage, you know how to solve problems as they come along. You don't have to refer to your data science scripts, and you can start focusing on producing results. Here, you start to focus on optimizing your models. Stage 5: Mastery (Contribution) - While I don't believe that anyone has mastered data science, I believe that you reach this data science learning stage by contributing to the field in a meaningful way. There are few people that reach this stage, and most of them are likely living in academia. #DataScience #KenJee #LearnDataScience More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

Kd nuggets link: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/why-data-scientists-leaving-jobs.html Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 The problem with data science is that many data scientists don't feel fulfilled by their work. This originates from two ares 1) companies hire data scientists without fully understanding their capabilities 2) data science careers still aren't well defined. For data scientists: To avoid these pitfalls ask relevant questions in interviews, learn the team and the politics around it. Make sure to understand the other roles that fill out the team as well. For companies: Make sure that leaders understand what data science is and what it is not. Also more narrowly define data science positions (Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, etc.). Seek the input from data scientists and give them feedback. #DataScience #KenJee More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

(What the Numbers Say),"#DataScience #KenJee #SportsAnalytics #AstrosCheatingScandal The Code: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/Astros_Analysis http://signstealingscandal.com/ https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/baseball/stats.html#V.1.8.0.1.0.0.2009.2018 https://www.playingnumbers.com/2020/02/did-cheating-really-help-the-astros-win/ In this video I walk through my analysis of the Astros Cheating scandal. From the data that Tony Adams collected, I look at the correlation between the number of trash can bangs and the number of runs scored. I also use a linear regression and a logistic regression to determine if trash can bangs have predictive power over runs and wins. Shockingly the correlation and linear regression suggested that there was very little relationship between bangs and runs scored. The logistic regression also suggested that bangs were not a predictor of wins. I was shocked by this, but I knew that I had to look deeper. After additional analysis, I found that the number of bangs in losses were significantly greater than the number in wins. If the Astros were mainly cheating when they were behind, this would likely not show in the models we built before. I also looked at the number of bangs in games when the Astros were down early. I found that there is a large spike in bangs when they are down in the first 3 innings. To see if this had a meaningful impact, I looked at their win % for games when they were behind by inning. I found that they greatly outperformed the average team when this was the case.

There are very few college students that land Data Science Jobs right out of school. These are my tips to maximize your university experience and to give you the best career options going forward. 1) Get as much experience as you can. You can do this through data science internships, projects, or research with your professors. 2) It doesn't matter what you study if you are comfortable with going back to grad school. If you don't want to go back to school and still want to work in data science, you should study CS, Physics, Math, Statistics, or some other quantitative discipline. 3) Use your professor's free time. These people have dedicated their lives to their given field and you should learn from them as much as you can. 4) Use your school network as much as possible. 5) Do data science projects that interest you and share them. 6) Join data science clubs or start them. 7) Go to conferences at the student rate. 8) Don't stress about it. #DataScience #KenJee Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1 More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag *I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

Moneyball shaped what is traditionally thought of as sports analytics; however, there are many other types of sports analytics aside from helping teams win. Type 1: Moneyball - In this role your main goal is to help teams win. You will either help coaches make decisions, players improve performance, or work with your organization to optimize draft picks and trades. Type 2: DFS & Sports gambling - These careers are primarily focused on predicting the outcome of games. You can work for a sports book, a company recommending picks, or in a portfolio gambling with your own money. Type 3: Media - Your focus here will be on story telling. Sports analytics in the media try to make the games more interesting by complementing play with statistics. Type 4: Industry - Companies use sports data to create products for sports teams and fans.

Watch this video to see which one may be right for you Data Science Certificate - Positives (Inexpensive, low time commitment, can help you build out your portfolio) - Negatives (Likely wont get you a job, not very academically rigerous) - Good for someone with a phd looking to get data science on their resume or a beginner who wants to see if data science would be interesting to them Data Science Bootcamp - Positives (Good networking and resume resources, reasonable academic rigor) - Negatives (Very expensive, hit or miss with education, very time consuming) - Good for someone who has a good portfolio and needs the networking help, someone with a phd in an unrelated field or masters in a related field, or someone who has extra cash to spend Data Science Masters degree - Positives (checks the graduate degree box, access to university network and resources, internship opportunities, decent exit opportunities) - Negatives (Most expensive, very time consuming) - This is a good option for someone who is already an analyst and wants to move into a data science role or someone who wants to become a data analyst but has no relevant experience. #DataScience #KenJee #DataScienceMasters #DataScienceBootcamp More from Ken Jee: https://www.playingnumbers.com https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",22,People & Blogs,PT16M15S,975,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9FjwzKFPuM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,37865,1164,26,0,280

Is it better to be longer or straighter? #DataScience #SportsAnalytics #GolfAnalyltics Every Shot Counts: https://amzn.to/2QOPDRC I compare Cameron Champ, Keegan Bradley and Chez Reavie in this video. My goal is to understand which player you would rather have drive the ball for you given that your approach game is that of an average PGA Tour player. To do this, we need to understand the probability that players hit the ball into areas other than the fairway and the expected strokes from each distance and location. I compare the expected score per hole for each of these players for the average par 4 on the PGA tour (~430 yards). I also compare the scoring for varying hole lengths. I found that Cameron Champ holds the advantage in all hole lengths, but his advantage grows as the holes get longer. In most circumstances, you would want the longer driver; however, there are a few cases where this isn't so. (1) When an individual player is better from a longer range than a shorter range (2) when the golf course is particularly penal to misses in the rough or has a high instance of out of play or penalty shots off the tee. The strokes gained baselines that are used are from the every shot counts book (2014) so they may not be representative of players on the current PGA Tour.

With these two inputs we can very accurately approximate the win % of a baseball season. The equation for this is (runs scored)^2 / ((runs scored)^2 + (runs against)^2) If we can reliably project the expected runs scored and runs scored against for the next season, we can reliably extrapolate that to how many games they are expected to win. Wit this we can also evaluate how much of a positive or negative impact a new player will have on a team. We can predict the number of runs that a new player will create. With this formula, we are able to predict the number of wins that this accounts for. This is extremely important for teams when they are evaluating trades and valuing players. They can determine how much a player is worth based on the wins that they contribute. This equation can be related to other sports as well, although it is slightly less accurate. Because the number of points scored in football and basketball is higher than baseball, we have to adjust the exponent that we use in the equation More from Ken Jee: https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",17,Sports,PT6M16S,376,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZWdyBbgGZBQ/maxresdefault.jpg,1,1724,81,0,0,15

YouTube does a great job of presenting useful descriptive statistics to it's users; however I wanted to dig a little deeper into my viewership numbers. I wanted to determine if it was possible to increase the growth of my channel with the insights gleaned from my analysis. #DataScience #DataScienceProjects GitHub Repo: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/YouTube_Data First I visualize the data using matplotlib. I show the last year of my views, watch time, subscribers, likes, and few other metrics. Next, I normalize these charts by looking at a 7 day rolling average. It is clear from the charts that I have experienced steady growth over the last year. There are some spikes that I have attributed to social media posts that I have made. Next I wanted to determine if there was a best day for me to post videos. After normalizing the data to remove days with videos and social media posts, it appears that Monday's have a slight uptick in viewership. After this, I wanted to determine actually how much each feature impacts my watch time and subscriber count. I ran two multiple linear regressions, one with watch time as the dependent variable and one where subscriber count was the dependent variable. The features that I chose to try to predict watch time accounted for ~82% of the variance in my videos. I found that a new post generally attributed to a ~50 minutes of increased view time. A Intro post generally attributed to twice as much ~110 minutes of view time, and a video posted equated to about ~185 minutes of increased view time. The only day of the week that had a significant p-value was Thursday, and on those days I received ~22 min less viewership. For subscribers these factors only explained ~35% of the variance. Interestingly enough, the only significant factors were watch time of the previous day, If I did a facebook intro post, and the day after I published a video. If I did a facebook intro post my model suggests that I will gain ~17 followers the next day. The day after I post a video I can also expect an additional 3 subscribers.

I expanded on this analysis to determine where the NBA should put a 4-point line if they were to create one. I recommend watching the NBA 3 point line video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BEtGaz70rQ) before watching this one. The main idea here is that the NBA 4 point line should be at a place where the points per shot of all 4 pointers are equal to the points per shot of all 3 pointers and all 2 pointers. To do this analysis we need two things (1) the make probability by distance and (2) the distribution of 4-point shots To estimate make probability by distance, I used a logistic regression. This gave us a reasonably accurate, normalized, view of the world here. To estimate the proportion of shots taken behind the 4-point line, I used the same distribution as three pointers. We are not using the same raw shots, just the percentage of 3's, now 4's that are taken from each incremental distance behind the arc. I found that the new 4-point line would be at 26' which is only incrementally further back than my proposed 3-point line.

Data Science has a steep learning curve. You also have to invest in learning after getting a job or finishing school. - Can you identify problems and seek out solutions? People will not tell you how to solve every problem. You have to be creative enough to identify problems and generate custom solutions to them - Do you have an aptitude for math? The foundation of data science is in math. You need to be comfortable with this to excel in the field. - Are you interested in computer science and programming? Most day to day data science work requires programming. You must be comfortable learning these techniques. - Do you have a knack for story telling and explaining complex concepts in simple terms?

This video will show you how to clean data by removing and/or imputing null values, cleaning and standardizing data types, and using graphs to understand anomalies in your data. #DataScience #DataScienceFundamentals #DataCleaning #Python Fundamentals Exploration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9dGmL2G-4k&list=PL2zq7klxX5ATPC8RuqCuTDdki3b4NqKQv&index=2&t=23s Fundamentals Manipulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIJrCFXs0rU&list=PL2zq7klxX5ATPC8RuqCuTDdki3b4NqKQv&index=3&t=0s Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/ Data: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data Code with comments: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/fundamentals Concepts Shown: 1:53 Read in the data 2:55 Understand features of the data set 3:25 Remove duplicates from data set 4:15 Finding columns with null values & finding the % null in each column 6:50 Removing null values 10:00 Imputing null values 12:45 Cleaning text data 15:30 Converting between data types 22:20 Box plots and histograms 25:00 Normalizing outliers 30:30 Feature scaling Min-Max More from Ken Jee: https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",27,Education,PT34M44S,2084,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4yI3vVe0Jos/maxresdefault.jpg,1,2774,105,2,0,31

Strokes gained was created my Mark Broadie a Colombia business school professor. Strokes gained is a normalized metric that allows us to compare type of shot apples to apples. They are compared using fractions of strokes. This is very similar to how wins above replacement is used in baseball. Strokes gained is also an aggregated / normalized metric. In order to get strokes gained, we compare each shot, hole, round, and tournament to the average. If a player shoots 72 and the average score for the day is 73, then they have +1 strokes gained on the round. Players who play better than average should always have positive total strokes gained and players who perform worse than average should always have negative strokes gained total. #DataScience #SportsAnalytics #StrokesGained More from Ken Jee: https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",17,Sports,PT9M35S,575,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3cDM9Z-fdz4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,988,25,0,0,4

I also speak to how these relate to my work in data science. In my economics degree, I learned to see the world in trends and numbers. This changed my way of thinking from my highschool days and set the groundwork for learning data science. In my first masters degree, I learned how to tell a story and understand a business. I wanted to get into management consulting, so I learned business strategy and entrepreneurship. I also learned some SQL and basic R programming. In my masters in Computer Science, I concentrated in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I learned Python, R, Scala, Java, C and a few other programming languages. I also learned software engineering principles, how databases work, and networking principles. All of this education worked for me, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this path for everyone. If you are a self starter, I suggest trying to self study instead. The quality of the content on the internet is as good as any university taught data science course. If I could go back and do it again, I would have started on a more technical path. I also would have leveraged the networks that I developed. #DataScience #GraduateSchool More from Ken Jee: https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",27,Education,PT12M42S,762,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMOA5arCi8g/maxresdefault.jpg,1,622,35,1,0,10

Learn SQL and be efficient with manipulating data in Python or R. 2) You don't always get to work on projects that are exciting to you. In school you choose many of the data sets and projects that you do. Almost universally, at work, your day to day projects are dictated by your boss. 3) You can learn a tremendous amount from other people. Data Scientists are incredibly smart and come from a range of backgrounds. 4) Data science is constantly growing. With the field being broadly defined, there is almost a limitless amount of things to learn. 5) Office politics do play a role in data science. If you are interested in management after data science, it could be good to know who makes the strategic decisions. 6) Data science is very different at different companies depending on the size and growth phase of the organization. 7) Put some time into learning implementation frameworks (Docker & Sagemaker) 8) Statistical significance plays a different role in the business setting. If the expected value is positive, you should at least try it. #DataScience More from Ken Jee: https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/ https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee https://kennethjee.com/ https://github.com/PlayingNumbers My Stuff Best Alarm Clock Ever: https://amzn.to/2MNrXJH GIANT Sticky Pad: https://amzn.to/2IWBQDY Creepy Mannequin: https://amzn.to/2MjzC3q - Camera: https://amzn.to/2MKiao0 Web-Cam: https://amzn.to/2OU1ptc Monitor: https://amzn.to/2Bjp7ag",28,Science & Technology,PT8M58S,538,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z_KFh-HqaBA/maxresdefault.jpg,1,12219,524,6,0,48

Data science involves data manipulation (SQL / NOSQL), descriptive analysis, and advanced analysis (ML techniques) Machine Learning - A subset of data science. This focuses mainly on two types of algorithms. Supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning usually refers to classification and regression problem, while unsupervised learning relates to feature reduction or clustering algorithms. Artificial Intelligence - Barrows from some parts of machine learning, but a portion of it sits outside of data science or ML. There are generally two types specialized intelligence and generalized intelligence. Specialized intelligence focuses on replicating human decision making in a small feature space.

This transition takes some serious effort, but is definitely attainable! In data science, you need a specific set of skills. From a business or economics background, you generally need to brush up on the coding and technical skills first. You should focus on learning python or R first. You will also need to develop an understanding of SQL. There are some great free resources to learn these skills, but my favorite is kaggle. Depending on your experience, you may have more success breaking into data science through the visualization and story telling route. Learning Tableau or Power BI can be an incredible asset for data science teams. Generally, you can self study using online data science courses, or you can go back to graduate school to get a data science degree.
