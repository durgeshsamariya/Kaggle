Notably, as a fellow in the NIH (US), I prototyped a pipeline that uses genomic and EHR-level information to create personalized models of disease risk. Alongside being published in international peer-reviewed journals, my work has earned several awards in the UK and US, including the NYC Open Data competition for a Data Science project in 2018. I am currently a data scientist in H2O.ai, working closely with companies in the healthcare industry helping them to expand their capabilities using AI. About the talk: As data processing and storage is becoming cheaper, the main barrier to entry for AI adoption is often data availability. This couldn’t be better exemplified than in medicine, where advancements in AI-enabled clinical decision support are mirroring innovations of how data are recorded and stored within healthcare systems. AI-enabled clinical decision support includes diagnosis and prognosis, and involves classification or regression algorithms that can predict the probability of a medical outcome or the risk for a certain disease. Several image classification algorithms using medical images have been approved by the FDA as diagnostic tools in the last two years, and more are certain to follow. Similarly, FDA approval has already been given to wearable devices that monitor vital signs to capture irregularities. These early examples demonstrate the huge potential of AI applications in medicine, as the volume and variety of medical data that get captured increases. More than 80-90% of US hospitals and physician offices are implementing some form of an EHR, and similar or even higher adoption rates are seen globally. Despite persistent outstanding issues, the lack of interoperability between EHR systems or patient history continuity, past barriers to adoption relating to data usability and availability are being overcome. Three examples of clinical decision support AI models built on EHR data will be discussed. (1) Accumulation of medical histories from birth alongside linked maternal EHR information in a healthcare facility, enabled the prediction of high obesity risk children as early as two years after birth, possibly allowing life-altering preventative interventions. (2) The Advanced Alert Monitoring system developed and deployed by Kaiser Permanente uses Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data to predict fatally deteriorating cases and alert staff to the need of life-saving interventions. (3) Last, but not least, clinical decision support systems are often required to provide sufficient explanations of their predictions. Global and local explanations of predictions regarding hospital readmissions demonstrate how interpretability techniques enable such explanations. As EHR information becomes standardized and enriched with eg. genomic information, medicine is poised to leverage AI breakthroughs to improve health outcomes.",27,Education,PT30M46S,1846,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hf_u3YRnUkA/maxresdefault.jpg,,389,12,0,0,0

About the talk: The vast majority of successful deep neural networks are trained using variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, and (2) accelerated schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the sequence of ""fast weights"" generated by another optimizer. I will discuss how neural network algorithms can be analyzed and show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible computation and memory cost. I will then present empirical results demonstrating Lookahead can significantly improve the performance of SGD and Adam, even with their default hyperparameter settings on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, neural machine translation, and Penn Treebank.",27,Education,PT25M11S,1511,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TxGxiDK0Ccc/maxresdefault.jpg,,417,12,0,0,0

Given the infancy in the field, there has been limited exploration into the assessment of the performance of explainability methods, with most evaluations centered on subjective and visual interpretations of current approaches. In this talk, the speakers introduce two quantitative performance metrics for quantifying the performance of explainability methods on deep neural networks via a novel decision-making impact analysis: 1.) Impact Score, which assesses the percentage of critical factors with either strong confidence reduction impact or decision changing impact; and 2.) Impact Coverage, which assesses the percentage coverage of adversarially impacted factors in the input.

That's often the position data scientists find themselves in: rather than having a clear A/B test to analyze, they frequently are in the business of combing through user funnels to ensure that each stage is working as expected.  It takes a very detail-oriented and business-savvy team to pull off an investigation with that broad a scope, but that's exactly what Medium has: a group of product-minded data scientists dedicated to investigating anomalies and identifying growth opportunities hidden in heaps of user data.

Chang holds a Master's of Applied Science in Operations Research from the University of Toronto, where she specialized in combinatorial optimization. She also holds a Bachelor's Degree in mathematics from the University of Waterloo. About the talk: This talk will introduce differential privacy and its use cases, discuss the new component of the TensorFlow Privacy library, and offer real-world scenarios for how to apply the tools. In recent years, the world has become increasingly data-driven and individuals and organizations have developed a stronger awareness and concern for the privacy of their sensitive data. It has been shown that it is impossible to disclose statistical results about a private database without revealing some information. In fact, the entire database could be recovered from a few query results. Following research on the privacy of sensitive databases, a number of big players such as Google, Apple, and Uber have turned to differential privacy to help guarantee the privacy of sensitive data. That attention from major technology firms has helped bring differential privacy out of research labs and into the realm of software engineering and product development. Differential privacy is now something that smaller firms and software startups are adopting and finding great value in. Apart from privacy guarantees, advances in differential privacy also allow businesses to unlock more capabilities and increased data utility. One of these capabilities includes the ability to transfer knowledge from existing data through differentially private ensemble models without data privacy concerns. As differential privacy garners recognition in large tech companies, efforts to make current state-of-the-art research more accessible to the general public and small startups are underway. As a contribution to the broader community, Georgian Partners has provided its differential privacy library to the TensorFlow community.

Within two months, that cluster of cases would snowball into a full-blown pandemic, with hundreds of thousands — perhaps even millions — of infections worldwide, with the potential to unleash a wave of economic damage not seen since the 1918 Spanish influenza or the Great Depression. The exponential growth that led us from a few isolated infections to where we are today is profoundly counterintuitive. And it poses many challenges for the epidemiologists who need to pin down the transmission characteristics of the coronavirus, and for the policy makers who must act on their recommendations, and convince a generally complacent public to implement life-saving social distancing measures. With the coronas in full bloom, I thought now would be a great time to reach out to Jeremy Howard, co-founder of the incredibly popular Fast.ai machine learning education site.

Bur in reality, the job description is much more flexible: your job as a data scientist is to solve problems that people actually have with data. You’ll notice that I wrote “problems that people actually have” rather than “build models”. It’s relatively rare that the problems people have actually need to be solved using a predictive model. Instead, a good visualization or interactive chart is almost always the first step of the problem-solving process, and can often be the last as well. And you know who understands visualization strategy really, really well? Plotly, that’s who. Plotly is a company that builds a ton of great open-source visualization, exploration and data infrastructure tools (and some proprietary commercial ones, too). Today, their tooling is being used by over 50 million people worldwide, and they’ve developed a number of tools and libraries that are now industry standard. So you can imagine how excited I was to speak with Plotly co-founder and Chief Product Officer Chris Parmer. Chris had some great insights to share about data science and analytics tooling, including the future direction he sees the space moving in.

That makes machine learning ideal for automating repetitive tasks that might historically have been carried out only by humans. But this strategy may not be the most exciting application of machine learning in the future: increasingly, researchers and even industry players are experimenting with generative models, that produce much more complex outputs like images and text from scratch. These models are effectively carrying out a creative process - and mastering that process hugely widens the scope of what can be accomplished by machines. My guest today is Xander Steenbrugge, and his focus is on the creative side of machine learning. In addition to consulting with large companies to help them put state-of-the-art machine learning models into production, he's focused a lot of his work on more philosophical and interdisciplinary questions - including the interaction between art and machine learning.

Despite the efforts to build robust predication and classification models, data errors still the main reason for having low quality results. This massive labor-intensive exercises to clean data remain the main impediment to automatic end-to-end AI pipeline for data science. In this talk, I focus on data prep and cleaning as an inference problem, which can be automated by leveraging modern abstractions in ML. I will describe the HoloClean framework, a scalable prediction engine for structured data. The framework has multiple successful proof of concepts with cleaning census data, market research data, and insurance records. The pilots with multiple commercial enterprises showed a significant boost to the quality of source (training) data before feeding them to downstream analytics. HoloClean builds two main probabilistic models: a data generation model (describing how data was intended to look like); and a realization model (describing how errors might be introduced to the intended clean data). The framework uses few-shot learning, data augmentation, and self supervision to learn the parameters of these models, and use them to predict both error and their possible repairs.""",27,Education,PT31M48S,1908,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2RQz9zdpy0/maxresdefault.jpg,,1586,25,0,0,1

Five years ago, that wasn’t the case at all: data science and machine learning were all the rage, and managers were impressed by fancy analytics and over-engineered predictive models. Today, a healthy dose of reality has set in, and most companies see data science as a means to an end: it’s way of improving the experience of real users and real, paying customers, and not a magical tool whose coolness is self-justifying. At the same time, as more and more tools continue to make it easier and easier for people who aren’t data scientists to build and use predictive models, data scientists are going to have to get good at new things. And that means two things: product instinct, and data storytelling. That’s why we wanted to chat with Nate Nichols, a data scientist turned VP of Product Architecture at Narrative Science — a company that’s focused on making data communication easy.

We will discuss at a high level basic notions of that field in order to give to newcomers a clear idea of what is Machine learning. Formally, machine learning is the science of getting computers to realise a task without being explicitly programmed. So, in general, machine learning is incredibly useful for difficult tasks when we have incomplete information or information that’s too complex to be coded by hand. In these cases, we can give the information we have available to our model and let this one “learn” the missing information that it needs by itself. The two main categories of machine learning techniques are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Roughly, supervised learning models associate a label with each data point described by its features whereas unsupervised learning models find structures among all the data points. So, in this video, we will give an overview of all of these basic notions: data, features, labels, supervised, unsupervised, regression, classification, clustering, dimension reduction... all the required keys to understand further ML concepts.

What's interesting about data science is that although it's a software role, it doesn't quite follow this rule. That's because data scientists are often the only people who can understand the practical business consequences of their work. There's only one person on the team who can answer questions like, ""What does the variance in our cluster analysis tell us about user preferences?"" and "" What are the business consequences of our model's ROC score?"", and that person is the data scientist. In that sense, data scientists have a very important responsibility not to leave any insights on the table, and to bring business instincts to bare even when they're dealing with deeply technical problems.  For today's episode, we spoke with Rocio Ng, a data scientist at LinkedIn, about the need for strong partnerships between data scientists and product managers, and the day-to-day dynamic between those roles at LinkedIn.

Max walks us through applications where companies used deep learning creatively, applying vision deep learning models to non-vision domains. In each of these cases, a non-computer vision problem was transformed and stated in such a way as to leverage the power of a deep learning model suitable for image classification.

Its SQL-like syntax allows us to retrieve specific information from our worksheet, enabling various filtering, sorting, lookup, and aggregation capabilities. While this function is more powerful than INDEX/MATCH, VLOOKUP, SUMPRODUCT, SUMIFS and others, its syntax is rather simple: QUERY(Data, Query, [Headers]) Querying data from your GoogleSheets source has never been easier: using QUERY's function syntax QUERY(Data, Query, [Headers]) we can take advantage of database-like magic all within the consruct of a spreadsheet. Data – range of cells we want to query from Query – actual query code, to be enclosed in quotation marks or be a reference to a cell containing query text.
