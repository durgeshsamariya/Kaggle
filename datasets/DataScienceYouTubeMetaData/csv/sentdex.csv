Because of this, we're going to learn and immediately apply at the same time as we move through these concepts.

Before we get into the neural network model, and training it, one other thing to think about is that, chances are, the vast majority of our moves are going to be forward. If we throw data at a neural network that is, for example, 80% biased towards this, the neural network will learn to always predict that class, EXCEPT in cases where it's seen that it is not. The problem here is that the network will almost certainly overfit. So, in training and validation, you might see that you're accuracy is 99%, so surely it's not just only predicting that 80% class, but, then, you throw some out out sample data at the network, or even attempt to actually use it, and you're baffled by the results!

I noticed that the times when the lanes would ""both"" be on one side or the other was when we were getting to close to one of the edges. So next I wondered, hmm, what if we just work with the following logic: If one lane's slope is positive, and the other is negative, then we're fine, continue straight. If both lane's slopes are negative, then we're too far left, and we should turn right. If both lane's slopes are posotive, then we're too far right, and we should turn left. ...surely it can't be that simple right?

Maybe you haven't yet needed to do such things, but, eventually you may find yourself in a situation where you do want to temporarily track what your code is doing, but not always. Using print can help in a pinch, but your life will be easier in the long run if you bake logging into your code early on.

Object Oriented Programming is a hard thing to define, but it's centered around the creation of objects and interacting with them, as you might guess. Objects have characteristics and features, known as attributes, and can do various things, through their methods. The biggest feature of OOP is how well objects can be interacted with, and even molded in the future, which makes them very friendly to developers, scale, change over time, testing, and much more. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT11M35S,695,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ekA6hvk-8H8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,45764,533,10,0,62

In this part, we're going to talk about the built-in library: multiprocessing. Let us take a moment to talk about the GIL. The GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. What the GIL does for us is... hmm... well it serves as a sort of memory management safeguard. Sounds like a good idea I guess, but not really. The real problem is that, since the GIL has existed, people have built infrastructure around it. There are better options today, but ripping out the GIL would be catastrophic. Alright, so the GIL is here to stay for probably a while. What's that mean? Python is single threaded. Even if you use threading, Python runs on a single CPU. If you have 4 physical cores, your computer probably thinks you have 8, and you're using 1 of those 8, including when threading. All threading really lets you do is access idle threads, and nothing more. It's not using more power, its just using idle power. If you monitor your CPU %, you might see that you're only using 10 or 15%, instead of the desired 100%, or at least close to it. Well that stinks! What can we do?!

It's also more Pythonic to go ahead and just write the generator expression since it's simpler. That said, you should still know how to write a generator, since it will give you a bit more insight into how generators work, and what iterable objects really are, since, despite looking a lot like list comprehension, generators are very unique in how they act.

In this series, we're going to be taking the ""next steps"" after one has become comfortable with the basics of Python, and has been working with it for a bit. Up to this point, my tutorials have all been done using very basic, rudimentary Python. My definition of basic Python: code that is meant to ""just make it run."" This is fine for beginners, because there's not much point in overloading with nuances (most people wont retain it, since they don't care, at least I didn't when I was starting out). I define intermediate Python code as: Modular - Easily used by others and/or in other projects by you or others. Basically, write code with the intention to honor DRY (don't repeat yourself). Maintainable - ...Both by the original author and by other users. Is it easily read-able and understood? Scales - For this to happen, code needs to be efficient when it runs, and be able to scale. Think about reading files, working with requests, or doing calculations. Maintainability also plays a major role in scaling. In general, code that meets the above standards in Python is done with the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. There does exist another paradigm, called Functional Programming (FP), and there are bloody wars fought over which is better. We're going to use OOP. Either one of these is better than outright scripting, which what most beginner programmers are really doing. To begin this series, I am going to teach a few basic standard library functions and functionalities of Python that will replace otherwise bad habits in programming, before getting into Object Oriented Programming and design. https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/ https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT7M48S,468,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YSe9Tu_iNQQ/maxresdefault.jpg,1,176721,1806,13,0,159

We're going to be working first with the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset that contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of hand-written and labeled digits, 0 through 9, so ten total ""classes."" I will note that this is a very small dataset in terms of what you would be working with in any realistic setting, but it should also be small enough to work on everyone's computers. The MNIST dataset has the images, which we'll be working with as purely black and white, thresholded, images, of size 28 x 28, or 784 pixels total. Our features will be the pixel values for each pixel, thresholded. Either the pixel is ""blank"" (nothing there, a 0), or there is something there (1). Those are our features. We're going to attempt to just use this extremely rudimentary data, and predict the number we're looking at (a 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9). We're hoping that our neural network will somehow create an inner-model of the relationships between pixels, and be able to look at new examples of digits and predict them to a high degree. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT32M51S,1971,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhpvH5DuVu8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,256814,2508,57,0,502

In this tutorial, we are going to be covering some basics on what TensorFlow is, and how to begin using it. Libraries like TensorFlow and Theano are not simply deep learning libraries, they are libraries *for* deep learning. They are actually just number-crunching libraries, much like Numpy is. The difference is, however, a package like TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. But that's not all! We can even distribute computations across a distributed network of computers with TensorFlow. So, while TensorFlow is mainly being used with machine learning right now, it actually stands to have uses in other fields, since really it is just a massive array manipulation library. What is a tensor? Up to this point in the machine learning series, we've been working mainly with vectors (numpy arrays), and a tensor can be a vector. Most simply, a tensor is an array-like object, and, as you've seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.

The artificial neural network is a biologically-inspired methodology to conduct machine learning, intended to mimic your brain (a biological neural network). The Artificial Neural Network, which I will now just refer to as a neural network, is not a new concept. The idea has been around since the 1940's, and has had a few ups and downs, most notably when compared against the Support Vector Machine (SVM). For example, the Neural Network was popularized up until the mid 90s when it was shown that the SVM, using a new-to-the-public (the technique itself was thought up long before it was actually put to use) technique, the ""Kernel Trick,"" was capable of working with non-linearly separable datasets. With this, the Support Vector Machine catapulted to the front again, leaving neural nets behind and mostly nothing interesting until about 2011, where Deep Neural Networks began to take hold and outperform the Support Vector Machine, using new techniques, huge dataset availability, and much more powerful computers. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT22M33S,1353,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oYbVFhK_olY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,464903,4632,100,0,294

The Mean Shift algorithm finds clusters on its own. For this reason, it is even more of an ""unsupervised"" machine learning algorithm than K-Means. The way Mean Shift works is to go through each featureset (a datapoint on a graph), and proceed to do a hill climb operation. Hill Climbing is just as it sounds: The idea is to continually increase, or go up, until you cannot anymore. We don't have for sure just one local maximal value. We might have only one, or we might have ten. Our ""hill"" in this case will be the number of featuresets/datapoints within a given radius. The radius is also called a bandwidth, and the entire window is your Kernel. The more data within the window, the better. Once we can no longer take another step without decreasing the number of featuresets/datapoints within the radius, we take the mean of all data in that region and we have located a cluster center. We do this starting from each data point. Many data points will lead to the same cluster center, which should be expected, but it is also possible that other data points will take you to a completely separate cluster center. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT11M42S,702,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ERPpzrDkVg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,43436,546,8,0,39

It is used in almost every single major machine learning algorithm, so an understanding of it will help you to get the foundation for most major machine learning algorithms.

While I do not believe it is necessary to dig into all of the math that goes into every machine learning algorithm (have you dug into the source code of your other favorite modules to see how they do every little thing?), linear algebra is essential to machine learning, and it is useful to understand the true building blocks that machine learning is built upon. The objective of linear algebra is to calculate relationships of points in vector space. This is used for a variety of things, but one day, someone got the wild idea to do this with features of a dataset. We can too! Remember before when we defined the type of data that linear regression was going to work on was called ""continuous"" data? This is not so much due to what people just so happen to use linear regression for, it is due to the math that makes it up. Simple linear regression is used to find the best fit line of a dataset.

I remember the first time that I was trying to learn about machine learning, and most examples were only covering up to the training and testing part, totally skipping the prediction part. Of the tutorials that did the training, testing, and predicting part, I did not find a single one that explained saving the algorithm. With examples, data is generally pretty small overall, so the training, testing, and prediction process is relatively fast. In the real world, however, data is likely to be larger, and take much longer for processing. Since no one really talked about this important stage, I wanted to definitely include some information on processing time and saving your algorithm. While our machine learning classifier takes a few seconds to train, there may be cases where it takes hours or even days to train a classifier. Imagine needing to do that every day you wanted to forecast prices, or whatever.

I flipped the last two lines by mistake: X = np.array(df.drop(['label'],1)) X = preprocessing.scale(X) X_lately = X[-forecast_out:] X = X[:-forecast_out:] To forecast out, we need some data. We decided that we're forecasting out 10% of the data, thus we will want to, or at least *can* generate forecasts for each of the final 10% of the dataset. So when can we do this? When would we identify that data? We could call it now, but consider the data we're trying to forecast is not scaled like the training data was. Okay, so then what? Do we just do preprocessing.scale() against the last 10%? The scale method scales based on all of the known data that is fed into it. Ideally, you would scale both the training, testing, AND forecast/predicting data all together. Is this always possible or reasonable? No. If you can do it, you should, however. In our case, right now, we can do it. Our data is small enough and the processing time is low enough, so we'll preprocess and scale the data all at once. In many cases, you wont be able to do this. Imagine if you were using gigabytes of data to train a classifier. It may take days to train your classifier, you wouldn't want to be doing this every...single...time you wanted to make a prediction.

In the previous tutorials, we got our initial data, we transformed and manipulated it a bit to our liking, and then we began to define our features. Scikit-Learn does not fundamentally need to work with Pandas and dataframes, I just prefer to do my data-handling with it, as it is fast and efficient. Instead, Scikit-learn actually fundamentally requires numpy arrays. Pandas dataframes can be easily converted to NumPy arrays, so it just so happens to work out for us!

Finally, we're also importing the LinearRegression algorithm as well as svm from Scikit-learn, which we'll be using as our machine learning algorithms to demonstrate results. At this point, we've got data that we think is useful. How does the actual machine learning thing work? With supervised learning, you have features and labels. The features are the descriptive attributes, and the label is what you're attempting to predict or forecast. Another common example with regression might be to try to predict the dollar value of an insurance policy premium for someone. The company may collect your age, past driving infractions, public criminal record, and your credit score for example. The company will use past customers, taking this data, and feeding in the amount of the ""ideal premium"" that they think should have been given to that customer, or they will use the one they actually used if they thought it was a profitable amount. Thus, for training the machine learning classifier, the features are customer attributes, the label is the premium associated with those attributes. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT10M17S,617,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lN5jesocJjk/maxresdefault.jpg,1,552460,3748,131,0,591

The goal is to take continuous data, find the equation that best fits the data, and be able forecast out a specific value. With simple linear regression, you are just simply doing this by creating a best fit line. From here, we can use the equation of that line to forecast out into the future, where the 'date' is the x-axis, what the price will be. A popular use with regression is to predict stock prices. This is done because we are considering the fluidity of price over time, and attempting to forecast the next fluid price in the future using a continuous dataset. Regression is a form of supervised machine learning, which is where the scientist teaches the machine by showing it features and then showing it was the correct answer is, over and over, to teach the machine. Once the machine is taught, the scientist will usually ""test"" the machine on some unseen data, where the scientist still knows what the correct answer is, but the machine doesn't. The machine's answers are compared to the known answers, and the machine's accuracy can be measured. If the accuracy is high enough, the scientist may consider actually employing the algorithm in the real world. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT10M58S,658,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JcI5Vnw0b2c/maxresdefault.jpg,1,1152610,8240,172,0,1400

You will also need Scikit-Learn and Pandas installed, along with others that we'll grab along the way. Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the ""field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.""

First, we need to talk about propellers. https://pythonprogramming.net/quadcopter-flight-and-legal-tutorial/ There are two major types of propellelers. Some are threaded, some arent. If your motor's shaft isn't threaded, then you cannot use the threaded propellers. Threaded propellers are usually both the propeller and attachment system all in one. This is nice for quickly attaching and detatching the propellers, but it does not allow for you to balance the propeller. Almost no propellers come perfectly balanced, so you can safely assume the quick detatch ones are not perfect either. Despite this, I have had no issues personally with adjusting for differences in balance by modifying trim on the controller. If you can, then you can balance a propeller by adding tiny bits of tape to the underside of the propeller to add weight, and you use a propeller balancer. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT13M29S,809,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wXYZHfZVY-4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,21896,168,9,0,59

In this tutorial, we're going to do some final setting-up and calibrations. https://pythonprogramming.net/quadcopter-assembly-tutorial/ First, in order for your quadcopter to fly properly, you have to calibrate the ESCs. There are multiple ways to do this. At the most basic level, you can calibrate ESCs one by one, but, when using a control board, you can calibrate them all at the same time. Depending on your board, getting the ESC calibration mode might be different.

All quadcopters break down to the following (I will link to specific parts further down, do not want to clutter things at this point): Frame - This is what everything attaches to. Motors - Things that spin ESC - Electronic Speed Controllers, which dictate the speed at which your motors spin. Propellers - Attaches to motor to be spun and generate down-force Receiver (and transmitter) - Usually these come together. The transmitter is your ""remote controller"" and the receiver is what sits on the quadcopter to accept the incoming signal. Flight Control Board - Receives signal from your receiver, which then feeds out to your ESCs. Most flight control boards also have some basic stability control that helps to keep your quadcopter balanced. LiPo (Lithium Polymer) Battery - powers your quadcopter! Somewhere in the range of 1.3 - 2.2 amps. Power distribution Board - Takes power in from your battery, powers the ESCs which then power your motors, and also powers the flight control board. https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogra... https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT22M26S,1346,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZltBzPUPKI/maxresdefault.jpg,1,45769,426,20,0,46

If you recall leading up to this, we were often limited by what we wanted to do, usually be a 255 maximum on our stock universe. The Pipeline API allows you to select from more like 8000+ securities at a time, which opens the door to many new opportunities. The Pipeline API can reference 8000+ securities at a time, but you can still only reference 500 in realtime. Thus, you will most likely use the Pipeline API in conjunction with update_universe. In order to take 8000 securities and get to a number small enough to work with your universe, you will be using Factors and Filters, many times together. A factor is used to return numbers, and a filter returns a boolean. For example, you may use a factor first to apply a 50 and a 200 moving average to the companies. Then you may employ a filter to return all companies that have a 50 moving average above the 200 moving average.

Django is a Python web development framework, aimed at rapid development and deployment. One of the more common questions people have is ""which framework"" they should use. There are quite a few for Python, with Django and Flask being the two most popular. Flask is more of what we call a ""micro"" web framework. It is much ""lower level"" than Django is. This allows for more customization and control for the developer. Django is much more of a higher-level framework, and imposes a set structure on the developer. Thus, with Flask you can create systems your way, which is probably not most efficient, fastest, or secure way. With Django, you are a bit more constrained, but you are going to most likely do it the best way possible. As with almost all questions people ask me regarding which to use, the answer is: Try a few, and choose the one you like best. In the end, Django and Flask can be used to make the exact same websites! To try Django, you need to get Django first (you will also need Python installed).

SQLite, as the name suggests, is a lite version of an SQL database. SQLite3 comes as a part of the Python 3 standard library. Databases offer, typically, a superior method of high-volume data input and output over a typical file such as a text file. SQLite is a ""light"" version that works based on SQL syntax. SQL is a programming language in itself, but is a very popular database language. Many websites use MySQL, for example. SQLite truly shines because it is extremely lightweight. Setting up an SQLite database is nearly instant, there is no server to set up, no users to define, and no permissions to concern yourself with. For this reason, it is often used as a developmental and protyping database, but it can and is used in production. The main issue with SQLite is that it winds up being much like any other flat-file, so high volume input/output, especially with simultaneous queries, can be problematic and slow. You may then ask, what really is the difference between a typical file and sqlite. First, SQLite will let you structure your data as a database, which can easily be queried, so you get that functionality both with adding new content and calling upon it later. Each table would likely need its own file if you were doing plain files, and SQLite is all in one. SQLite is also going to be buffering your data. A flat file will require a full load before you can start querying the full dataset, SQLite files don't work that way. Finally, edits do not require the entire file to be re-saved, it's just that part of the file. This improves performance significantly. Alright great, let's dive into some SQLite. https://pythonprogramming.net/sql-database-python-part-1-inserting-database/ Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJh0sC5CqXLKZTSKU1YNo https://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/ https://plus.google.com/+sentdex",27,Education,PT10M59S,659,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o-vsdfCBpsU/maxresdefault.jpg,1,318682,3206,52,0,262

In order to filter like this you have a few options. Generally, you are probably going to convert your colors to HSV, which is ""Hue Saturation Value."" This can help you actually pinpoint a more specific color, based on hue and saturation ranges, with a variance of value, for example. If you wanted, you could actually produce filters based on BGR values, but this would be a bit more difficult. If you're having a hard time visualizing HSV, don't feel silly, check out the Wikipedia page on HSV, there is a very useful graphic there for you to visualize it.

In this tutorial, we'll be covering thresholding for image and video analysis. The idea of thresholding is to further-simplify visual data for analysis. First, you may convert to gray-scale, but then you have to consider that grayscale still has at least 255 values. What thresholding can do, at the most basic level, is convert everything to white or black, based on a threshold value. Let's say we want the threshold to be 125 (out of 255), then everything that was 125 and under would be converted to 0, or black, and everything above 125 would be converted to 255, or white. If you convert to grayscale as you normally will, you will get white and black. If you do not convert to grayscale, you will get thresholded pictures, but there will be color. While that sounds good enough, it often isn't. We will be covering multiple examples and different types of thresholding here to illustrate this.

We've come quite a long ways here, and the next, and final, macro step that we want to take here involves looking into economic indicators to see their impact on housing prices, or the HPI. Text based version of this tutorial and sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net/economic-factors-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/ There are two major economic indicators that come to mind out the gate: S&P 500 index (stock market) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product). I suspect the S&P 500 to be more correlated than the GDP, but the GDP is usually a better overall economic indicator, so I may be wrong. Another macro indicator that I suspect might have value here is the unemployment rate. If you're unemployed, you're probably not getting that mortgage. We'll see though. We've been through the process for adding more data points, so I do not see much point in dragging you all through this process. There will be one new thing to note, however. In the HPI_Benchmark() function, we're changing the ""United States"" column to be US_HPI. This makes a bit more sense when we're bringing in other values now. For GDP, I couldn't find one that encompassed the full time frame. I am sure you can find a dataset, somewhere, with this data, maybe even on Quandl. Sometimes you have to do some digging. I also had trouble finding a nice long-term monthly unemployment rate. I did find an unemployment level, but we really want more of a percentage/rate, otherwise we need to divide the unemployment level by the population.

At this point, we've learned quite a bit about what Pandas has to offer us, and we'll come up here with a bit of a challenge! As we've covered so far, we can make relatively low-risk investments based on divergence between highly correlated state pairs and probably do just fine. We'll cover testing this strategy later on, but, for now, let's look into acquiring the other necessary data that comprises housing values: Interest rates. Now, there are many different types of mortgage rates both in the way interest is accrued as well as the time-frame for the loan. Opinions vary over the years, and depending on the current market situation, on whether you want a 10 year, 15 year, or 30 year mortgage. Then you have to consider if you want an adjustable rate, or maybe along the way you decide you want to re-finance your home. At the end of the data, all of this data is finite, but ultimately will likely be a bit too noisy. For now, let's just keep it simple, and look into the 30 year conventional mortgage rate. Now, this data should be very negatively correlated with the House Price Index (HPI). Before even bothering with this code, I would automatically assume and expect that the correlation wont be as negatively strong as the higher-than-90% that we were getting with state HPI correlation, certainly less than -0.9, but also it should be greater than -0.5. The interest rate is of course important, but correlation to the overall HPI was so very strong because these were very similar statistics. The interest rate is of course related, but not as directly as other HPI values, or the US HPI.

In this tutorial, we're goign to talk briefly on the handling of erroneous/outlier data. Just because data is an outlier, it does not mean it is erroneous. A lot of times, an outlier data point can nullify a hypothesis, so the urge to just get rid of it can be high, but this isn't what we're talking about here. What would an erroneous outlier be? An example I like to use is when measuring fluctuations in something like, say, a bridge. As bridges carry weight, they can move a bit. In storms, that can wiggle about a bit, there is some natural movement. As time goes on, and supports weaken, the bridge might move a bit too much, and eventually need to be reinforced.

In this tutorial, we're going to be covering the application of various rolling statistics to our data in our dataframes. One of the more popular rolling statistics is the moving average. This takes a moving window of time, and calculates the average or the mean of that time period as the current value. In our case, we have monthly data. So a 10 moving average would be the current value, plus the previous 9 months of data, averaged, and there we would have a 10 moving average of our monthly data. Doing this is Pandas is incredibly fast. Pandas comes with a few pre-made rolling statistical functions, but also has one called a rolling_apply. This allows us to write our own function that accepts window data and apply any bit of logic we want that is reasonable. This means that even if Pandas doesn't officially have a function to handle what you want, they have you covered and allow you to write exactly what you need. Let's start with a basic moving average, or a rolling_mean as Pandas calls it. You can check out all of the Moving/Rolling statistics from Pandas' documentation.

In this part, we're going to be talking about missing or not available data. We have a few options when considering the existence of missing data. Ignore it - Just leave it there Delete it - Remove all cases. Remove from data entirely. This means forfeiting the entire row of data. Fill forward or backwards - This means taking the prior or following value and just filling it in. Replace it with something static - For example, replacing all NaN data with -9999. Each of these options has their own merits for a variety of reasons. Ignoring it requires no more work on our end. You may choose to ignore missing data for legal reasons, or maybe to retain the utmost integrity of the data. Missing data might also be very important data. For example, maybe part of your analysis is investigating signal drops from a server. In this case, maybe the missing data is super important to keep in the set. Next, we have delete it. You have another two choices at this point. You can either delete rows if they contain any amount of NaN data, or you can delete the row if it is completely NaN data. Usually a row that is full of NaN data comes from a calculation you performed on the dataset, and no data is really missing, it's just simply not available given your formula. In most cases, you would at least want to drop all rows that are completely NaN, and in many cases you would like to just drop rows that have any NaN data.

In this tutorial, we're going to be talking about smoothing out data by removing noise. There are two main methods to do this. The most popular method used is what is called resampling, though it might take many other names. This is where we have some data that is sampled at a certain rate. For us, we have the Housing Price Index sampled at a one-month rate, but we could sample the HPI every week, every day, every minute, or more, but we could also resample at every year, every 10 years, and so on. Another environment where resampling almost always occurs is with stock prices, for example. Stock prices are intra-second. What winds up happening though, is usually stock prices are resampled to minute data at the lowest for free data. You can buy access to live data, however. On a long-term scale, usually the data will be sampled daily, or even every 3-5 days. This is often done to keep the size of the data being transferred low. For example, over the course of, say, one year, intra-second data is usually in the multiples of gigabytes, and transferring all of that at once is unreasonable and people would be waiting minutes or hours for pages to load. Using our current data, which is currently sampled at once a month, how might we sample it instead to once every 6 months, or 2 years? Try to think about how you might personally write a function that might perform that task, it's a fairly challenging one, but it can be done. That said, it's a fairly computationally inefficient job, but Pandas has our backs and does it very fast.

In this tutorial, we're going to be covering how to combine dataframes in a variety of ways. In our case with real estate investing, we're hoping to take the 50 dataframes with housing data and then just combine them all into one dataframe. We do this for multiple reasons. First, it is easier and just makes sense to combine these, but also it will result in less memory being used. Every dataframe has a date and value column. This date column is repeated across all the dataframes, but really they should all just share the one, effectively nearly halving our total column count. When combining dataframes, you might have quite a few goals in mind. For example, you may want to ""append"" to them, where you may be adding to the end, basically adding more rows. Or maybe you want to add more columns, like in our case. There are four major ways of combining dataframes, which we'll begin covering now. The four major ways are: Concatenation, joining, merging, and appending. We'll begin with Concatenation.

Let's consider that we're multi-billionaires, or multi-millionaires, but it's more fun to be billionaires, and we're trying to diversify our portfolio as much as possible. We want to have all types of asset classes, so we've got stocks, bonds, maybe a money market account, and now we're looking to get into real estate to be solid. You've all seen the commercials right? You buy a CD for $60, attend some $500 seminar, and you're set to start making your 6 figure at a time investments into property, right? Okay, maybe not, but we definitely want to do some research and have some sort of strategy for buying real estate. So, what governs the prices of homes, and do we need to do the research to find this out? Generally, no, you don't really need to do that digging, we know the factors. The factors for home prices are governed by: The economy, interest rates, and demographics. These are the three major influences in general for real estate value. Now, of course, if you're buying land, various other things matter, how level is it, are we going to need to do some work to the land before we can actually lay foundation, how is drainage etc. If there is a house, then we have even more factors, like the roof, windows, heating/AC, floors, foundation, and so on. We can begin to consider these factors later, but first we'll start at the macro level. You will see how quickly our data sets inflate here as it is, it'll blow up fast. So, our first step is to just collect the data. Quandl still represents a great place to start, but this time let's automate the data grabbing. We're going to pull housing data for the 50 states first, but then we stand to try to gather other data as well. We definitely dont want to be manually pulling this data. First, if you do not already have an account, you need to get one. This will give you an API key and unlimited API requests to the free data, which is awesome. Once you create an account, go to your account / me, whatever they are calling it at the time, and then find the section marked API key. That's your key, which you will need. Next, we want to grab the Quandl module. We really don't need the module to make requests at all, but it's a very small module, and the size is worth the slight ease it gives us, so might as well. Open up your terminal/cmd.exe and do pip install quandl (again, remember to specify the full path to pip if pip is not recognized). Next, we're ready to rumble, open up a new editor. http://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex",27,Education,PT11M4S,664,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GpvWlVinf0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,118691,877,18,0,208

In this tutorial, we will begin discussing IO, or input/output, with Pandas, and begin with a realistic use-case. To get ample practice, a very useful website is Quandl. Quandl contains a plethora of free and paid data sources. What makes this location great is that the data is generally normalized, it's all in one place, and extracting the data is the same method. If you are using Python, and you access the Quandl data via their simple module, then the data is automatically returned to a dataframe. For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to just manually download a CSV file instead, for learning purposes, since not every data source you find is going to have a nice and neat module for extracting the datasets. Let's say we're interested in maybe purchasing or selling a home in Austin, Texas. The zipcode there is 77006. We could go to the local housing listings and see what the current prices are, but this doesn't really give us any real historical information, so let's just try to get some data on this. Let's query for ""home value index 77006."" Sure enough, we can see an index here. There's top, middle, lower tier, three bedroom, and so on. Let's say, sure, we got a a three bedroom house. Let's check that out. Turns out Quandl already provides graphs, but let's grab the dataset anyway, make our own graph, and maybe do some other analysis. Go to download, and choose CSV. Pandas is capable of IO with csv, excel data, hdf, sql, json, msgpack, html, gbq, stata, clipboard, and pickle data, and the list continues to grow. Check out the IO Tools documentation for the current list. Take that CSV and move it into the local directory (the directory that you are currently working in / where this .py script is). sample code and text-based write up for this tutorial: http://pythonprogramming.net/input-output-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/ http://pythonprogramming.net https://twitter.com/sentdex",27,Education,PT17M12S,1032,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Z7wvippeko/maxresdefault.jpg,1,147630,1299,12,0,117

We could use for loops to at least keep the amount of code down, but we can also make use of these styles with Matplotlib. The idea of a style page is to write your customization to a style file, and then, to use those changes and apply them to your graph, all you do is import style and then use that specific style. This way, let's say you are finding yourself always changing various elements of your graphs. Instead of having to write 25-200 lines of customization code per chart, you can just write it once to a style, and then load in that style and apply all of those changes in two lines!

Before we can paper trade a strategy, we must first run a back test against minute-data. As we do this, we have to learn a few things about Quantopian's systems, and implications about strategies, minute data, and paper trading. Paper trading is where we take a strategy, and ""forward test"" it against actual market events. We ""trade"" with fake money, but the market events are unique and real.

What is going on welcome to a python for finance tutorial video. Just to clarify right out of the gate, a lot of people envision programming as being used solely for high frequency trading, since computers can execute trades faster than people. While that is true, and computers are used for High Frequency Trading (HFT), they are also used for a whole lot more in finance. We're going to show the use of programming for things like simple algorithmic trades like moving average crossovers, all the way to utilizing things like machine learning. Computers can be used for really anything from high frequency trading to long term investing. Computers allow you to test all of your ideas through what is called back-testing. Back testing is where we take our trading strategies and apply them to historical data to see how they would have done if we had employed them. Back testing comes with some inherent flaws. First off, the usual warning about historical results are not indicative of future ones, and back testing also tends to ignore things like execution time, or how long it takes to actually make a trade. Depending on execution time and the order size, you're almost certainly to experience what is called skid / slippage. Skid/slip is the change in price during an order, from the point of execution initialization to when you actually complete the order. All that said, back testing is still a must, and you will find as we go through this series that back testing can become a reliable method for looking into the future, and we can also add risk metrics on top of it. So, this series is going to go through automated trading with python for finance. It would be helpful to have at least some background in Python, though I will do my best to make it not necessary. I will explain the code each step of the way, and, should you have any questions or confusions, I am always happy to help. So let's get started. To do this series, we're going to build everything on top of a service called Quantopian. Quantopian is a web app that allows us to write pure python code, it's not a rendition of python, it is python, in their web based IDE, which is the editor we write code into. They have a ton of batteries included so to speak, which means they have a lot of the modules that we're going to be using. Modules are pre-written code that we can import and use so we don't have to write a hundred thousand lines of code to do machine learning, for example. For the newcomer to Python, modules can be a bit of a pain to acquire. Using Quantopian eliminates this pain completely. We also want to use Quantopian because their back-testing simulation is very noob friendly. Quantopian is built on top of python, a bunch of other modules, and a module called Zipline, which is a back-testing module for Python. Zipline can be used outside of Quantopian, so you can learn with Quantopian and then protect your algorithm if you wanted to by moving off their website, but, for now, it will make things extremely simple. Quantopian also has a ton of high quality data that we can use. Normally, you will need to go and acquire this data somehow. There are some really great data resources out there, but Quantopian makes this super easy too. sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net http://hkinsley.com https://twitter.com/sentdex http://sentdex.com http://seaofbtc.com",27,Education,PT13M41S,821,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RxjIOXstxCk/maxresdefault.jpg,1,178352,1857,19,0,181

This is the process where we remove word affixes from the end of words. The reason we would do this is so that we do not need to store the meaning of every single tense of a word. For example: Reader Reading Read Aside from tense, and even one of these is a noun, they all have the same meaning for their ""root"" stem (read). This way, we store one single value for the root stem of ""read."" Then, when we wish to learn more, we can look into the affixes that were on the end, like ""ing"" is an active word, or in the past, then you have reader as someone who reads... then just plain read as either past tense or current. sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net http://hkinsley.com https://twitter.com/sentdex http://sentdex.com http://seaofbtc.com",27,Education,PT8M16S,496,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGKTphqxR9Q/maxresdefault.jpg,1,158110,1441,18,0,88

This is the methodology used to ""clean up"" and prepare your data for analysis. One of the first steps to pre-processing is to utilize stop-words. Stop words are words that you want to filter out of any analysis. These are words that carry no meaning, or carry conflicting meanings that you simply do not want to deal with. The NLTK module comes with a set of stop words for many language pre-packaged, but you can also easily append more to this list.

By far, the most popular toolkit or API to do natural language processing is the Natural Language Toolkit for the Python programming language. The NLTK module comes packed full of everything from trained algorithms to identify parts of speech to unsupervised machine learning algorithms to help you train your own machine to understand a specific bit of text. NLTK also comes with a large corpora of data sets containing things like chat logs, movie reviews, journals, and much more!

The Oculus Rift is a Virtual Reality headset, and Elite: Dangerous is a massive online game, still in beta at the time of my filming this. Elite: Dangerous was clearly made with the Oculus Rift and VR in mind, as there are many little additions and changes to the game when you use the headset. Targeting is done by looking at the target rather than needing to point your ship right at it and menus pop up when you look in their direction, rather than needing to press a key. The cockpit feels very genuine and the immersion is superb. E:D is definitely a great game with or without the Oculus Rift, but, there is no question: The Oculus Rift dramatically improves the game. Yes, on the DK2, the resolution is a bit grainy, making small text hard to read at times, requiring you to lean in to read it, but, aside from reading text, I find myself completely forgetting about the grainy resolution. It is highly likely this will not be the case in the consumer edition of the Oculus Rift as well.

So, you will generally have something like your header and footer in your main template, with things like your navbar, logo/banner, and then your footer information. Then, in the body area, you have the body data actually coming from another template that ""extends"" the main template. http://seaofbtc.com http://sentdex.com http://hkinsley.com https://twitter.com/sentdex Bitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6",27,Education,PT15M32S,932,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZ5XKaNYTiw/maxresdefault.jpg,1,10664,63,1,0,22

Logic actually ends up being more like having logic in our HTML. We can do things like having For loops and if statements in our Python. Passing variables from our Flask Python files to HTML is fairly simple, and using Templates can save us a lot of time. Something like for each element in a list, place in a table, is completely possible. We also cover using try-except for error handling.

Flask is a web framework for the Python programming language. A lot of people are curious to know what the differences of Flask and other developmental frameworks, especially compared to the Python frameworks. In this video, we cover what Flask is and how it compares to other frameworks, then we talk about how we set up our development server. We are going to be using a real server here for development, not a local setup. We do this because, if you are trying to learn web development, then you must be interested in a live, real website. The problem with working on a local instance is then you have to transfer everything to an actual server. You will find very quickly that things work very different when you leave your home computer. Hosts that I recommend: digitalocean.com: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d1c4c6e66979 (use these guys if you want just a small, cheap server $5/mo) linode.com: https://www.linode.com/?r=b417bc672ff52d6c055fd7a56e024939c667b0fd (use these guys if you think your website will get more than 1k visitors a day, I prefer Linode to DO.) pythonanywhere.com (use these guys for super easy setup, not recommended, however, for their downtimes, and some access restrictions as compared to your typical server.)

Should be a fun ride. http://www.amazon.com/Hobbypower-Quadcopter-Friber-Folding-Multicopter/dp/B00DU4A4JK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1402170748&sr=8-3&keywords=x525 You will also need a transmitter (remote controller), a lipo battery, and a battery balancer/charger. http://seaofbtc.com http://sentdex.com http://hkinsley.com https://twitter.com/sentdex Bitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6",26,Howto & Style,PT9M26S,566,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lx6PKZdRV6w/maxresdefault.jpg,1,5049,32,1,0,7

The idea of styles is to serve a purpose similar to CSS stylesheets in web development. The idea here is that with charts, programmers tend to like to customize their data visualization by changing colors, fonts, and more within matplotlib. The problem arises when this requires a lot of effort and time, especially when you have multiple types of ""settings"" that you like to have for specific types of charts. Here, you can save all of your favorite settings in mpl style files that you can call up and reference to style your charts quickly and exactly how you want.

When this occurs, the robot car automatically will reverse. We programmed in a failsafe as well that if reverse does not work, a pivot will be attempted, more reversing, and, if all else fails, shutdown.

All viewers should understand that this is live trading, and any mistakes or poor decisions can result in the loss of some or all of their cryptocurrencies or fiat money. Be careful! Also take note that you are trusting a 3rd party with your bitcoin here. Do not put money on any exchange or with any 3rd party that you cannot afford to lose.

We assume that Python is already installed on your machine. If not, head over to: https://www.python.org/download/ and download Python 2.7! The API is intended for Java, though the IBPy module is a Python wrapper around the Java API which allows us to use Python. This tutorial will teach you how to actually execute an order through the TWS API. We cover installation of IBPy as well as TWS.

We still have to teach classes, among a few other necessary basics, but now would be a good time to talk about modules. IF you are using linux, installing Python modules is incredibly stupid easy. For programming, linux is just lovely when it comes to installing packages for just about whatever. I believe mac allows similar treatment, though I've not done it myself. When I was first starting out with Python, installing modules was one of the most difficult things, for a few reasons. Mainly, with windows, there are quite a few methods for installation of modules. you've got pip install setuptools, download and click'n'drag, or setup.py At the time of starting Python, a large part of my troubles was that I didn't actually understand the process of getting a module, and this is obviously very frustrating. Python is going to look in a few places for modules. That's going to be site-packages and the script's directory for the most part. There are some other places you can use, but let's leave them out of it. Knowing this allows you yourself to make your own modules, in the form of just a script if you want, putting that in the same directory as your main script, and then using import to bring it on board, you can also place multiple scripts in a dir and use that. Once you begin to familiarize yourself with this, and understand how and why things work, it will help you a lot.

In my videos, I get a lot of questions for help where people have errors and are not sure what the problem is. If they used some extremely simple debugging, they'd realize how obvious the answer is. Most of the time, the problem is a typo, followed closely by a misunderstanding of indentation and standards. Standards how are how you organize your code. With python, unlike most languages, you define blocks of code, like functions, by indentation. Most python editors will automatically indent for you where it is necessary. With this, if you are ever coding along and find python automatically indenting you where you don't think it should, this should raise a flag for you to figure out. There are some more in-depth common-issues that you'll find from time to time, you can find more debugging videos by searching for debugging in my channel. For now I will just keep these ones basic. The first error we'll discuss is the NameError: is not defined. As obvious as this might appear to you, this gets people amazingly frequently. Just learn to recognize the ""is not defined"" as a high chance that you have typoed the definition of the variable or when you are calling it. Basically, you typo-ed somewhere.

When users begin using functions, they can quickly become confused when it comes to global and local variables... getting a the dreaded variable is not defined even when they clearly see that it is... or so they think. These terms of global and local correspond to a variable's reach within a script or program. A global variable is one that can be accessed anywhere. A local variable is the opposite, it can only be accessed within its frame. The difference is that global variables can be accessed locally, but not modified locally inherently. A local variable cannot be accessed globally, inherently. Now, dont worry about committing that to memory right now, I think it makes a lot more sense when you just see and do it, so let's do that.

With this, we explained how having a lot of them could become troublesome and tedious for the programmer using the function. Luckily, there is a solution for this. Sometimes, it can make a lot of sense to make a complex function highly customize-able. That said, some people may want to use the function in it's simple... ""default"" ... form. Think about it like buying a car. Some people want to just buy the base model, with all the features that come by default from the factory. Other people want to customize their car in many different ways. Luckily, we allow people who want to customize their car the option to do it, but we do not ask every buyer of every car what kind of wheels they want, what brand of tire, what screws they want, what kind of leather seats by what brand, what windshield, what steering wheel, what lights... etc. This is just too much for some people and what they want to use the car for. Same goes for functions in programming. So we have function parameter defaults, which allow the function's creator to set ""default"" values to the function parameters. This allows anyone to use a function with the default values, yet lets anyone who wishes to customize them the ability to specify different values. When using defaults, any parameters with defaults should be the last ones listed in the function's parameters.

You can think of it a lot like why you choose to write and save a program, rather than writing out the entire program every time you want to execute it. To begin a function, the keyword 'def' is used to notify python of the impending function definition, which is what def stands for. From there, you type out the name you want to call your function. It is important to choose a unique name, and also one that wont conflict with any other functions you might be using. For example, you wouldn't want to go calling your function print.

The elif allows us to tie multiple if statements together as we might have intended to before with multiple if statements before we learned that the else will only be contingent on the if statement above it. The ""elif"" statement is a hybrid of the else and the if. The way it works is: We ask if something is the case. If it is, then the elif and the else will not run. If it is not, then the elif will run and question the if statement. If it is True, then it will run and the else will not run. If it is not true, then the else statement will run.

The idea of the for loop is to ""iterate"" through something. For each thing in that something, it will do a block of code. Most often, you will a for loop's structure very much like for eachThing in thisThing: do this stuff in this block So, again, why would someone use each type of loop? Typically, you will see the while loop being used for finite tasks that have predetermined length, and the for loop being used for tasks that have uncertain and variable time-frames. That said, the for loop can be used for the exact same tasks as the while loop. For this reason, I prefer the for loop myself, but again, it comes down to personal preference.

Variables act as placeholders for data. They can aid in short hand, as well as with logic, as variables can change, hence their name. Variables help programs become much more dynamic, and allow a program to always reference a value in one spot, rather than the programmer needing to repeatedly type it out, and, worse, change it if they decide to use a different definition for it. Variables can be called just about whatever you want. You wouldn't want them to conflict with function names, and they also cannot start with a number.

At first blush, it might appear that the print function is rather useless for programming, but it is actually one of the most widely used functions in all of python. The reason for this is that it makes for a great debugging tool. If something isn't acting right, you can use the print function to print out what is happening in the program. Many times, you expect a certain variable to be one thing, but you cannot see what the program sees. If you print out the variable, you might see that what you thought was, was not. Next up, strings, what are they? Strings are just ""strings"" of text, hence the name. Strings are a type of data. Another type of data is integers.

Hopefully I can help many of you out of that stage! Many people know they want to learn to program, but they are not sure which language to go with or where to start. Python is often chosen by beginners due to its ""high level"" nature. ""High level"" might make it sound like it is more complex or something, though it means the opposite. Python's syntax and other structuring is very simplistic and easy for even a beginner to follow. Many people find that they can actually read and understand what is going on with non-obfuscated Python code, even if they have no knowledge of Python or programming. Python is certainly one of the top languages for its use, and has been referred to as the ""second best language for anything."" You can use Python for web development, data analysis, robotics, games, AI, and a whole lot more. If you're looking to acquire the superpower of programming, I am here to help! If you stick around here enough, you'll find out that I like to belittle problems. Every major problem or goal can be broken down into parts. Learning to program is a massive undertaking. It can be extremely daunting for someone who is new to it. Luckily, the task of learning how to program can be broken down as well. Most programs are just combinations of a small handful of tools and operations built together to do awesome things. This is usually some if-statements in a few functions with a few loops and, boom, program! Let's take those baby steps. In this tutorial, you are shown how to install Python 3, as well as how to maintain installations of both Python 2 and Python 3. When I was making this video, Python 3.4 beta was out, so the most current version might be 3.4. Downloading that will be fine and the tutorial information will be identical. http://seaofbtc.com http://sentdex.com http://hkinsley.com https://twitter.com/sentdex Bitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6",26,Howto & Style,PT15M47S,947,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IX6mc9l6tY4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,375247,1812,165,0,250

Granularity in graphs refers to the level of detail they contain. Usually, the higher the granularity, the better the quality of the data is. That said, once you pass a certain point, say 10,000 plots on a single graph, the eye can not tell the difference and processing is wasted. Instead, developers should program into their applications granularity adjustments depending on the window that a user is looking. This will show you how to modify how many plots are actually shown on the graph, by averaging them in groups and only plotting up those averages. This will allow you to plot high granularity data sets without waiting for an hour for them to actually generate! They are not moving averages, so there is not lag in the line either, and all data is calculated backwards.

One of the largest that people are most familiar with would be facial recognition, which is the art of matching faces in pictures to identities. Image recognition goes much further, however. It can allow computers to translate written text on paper into digital text, it can help the field of machine vision, where robots and other devices can recognize people and objects. Here, our goal is to begin to use machine learning, in the form of pattern recognition, to teach our program what text looks like. In this case, we'll use numbers, but this could translate to all letters of the alphabet, words, faces, really anything at all. The more complex the image, the more complex the code will need to become. When it comes to letters and characters, it is relatively simplistic, however. How is it done? Just like any problem, especially in programming, we need to just break it down into steps, and the problem will become easily solved. Let's break it down! First, we know we want to show the program an image, and have it compare it to patterns that it knows to make an educated guess on what the current image is. This means we're going to need some ""memory"" of sorts, filled with examples. In the case of this tutorial, we'd like to do image recognition for the numbers zero through nine. So we'd like to be able to show it any random 2, and have it know the image to be a 2 based on the previous examples of 2's that it has seen and memorized. Next, we need to consider how we'll do this. A computer doesn't read text like we read text. We naturally put things together into a pattern, but a machine just reads the data. In the case of a picture, it reads in the image data, and displays, pixel by pixel, what it is told to display. Past that, a machine makes no attempt to decide whether it is showing a couch or a bird. So, our database of what examples are will actually be pixel information. To keep things simple, we should probably ""threshold"" the images. This means we store everything as black or white. In RGB code, that's a 255, 255, 255, or 0, 0, 0. That is per pixel. Sometimes there is alpha too! What we can then do is take any image, and, if the pixel coloring is say greater than 125, we could say, this is more of a ""white"" and convert it to 255 (the entire pixel). If it is less than 125 or equal to it, we could say this is more of a ""black"" and convert it to black. This might be problematic in some circumstances where we have a dark color on a darker color, usually a type of image meant to fool machines. We could have something in place instead to find the ""middle"" color on average for the current image, and threshold anything lighter to white and anything darker to black. This works very well for two-dimensional images of things like characters, but less well for things with shading that are meant to accompany the image, say of something like a ball. Once we've done this, all we need to do is save the string of pixel definitions for a bunch of ""example"" texts. We can start with a bunch of fonts, plus some hand drawn examples. There are data dumps of a bunch of examples. This is an example of ""training"" our data. If we have a decently sized database, then we are ready to try to compare some numbers. A good idea would be to hand-draw an example for your program to compare to. To compare, we'd just simply do the same thing to the question-image. We'd threshold the image into black or white pixels, then we take that pixel list, and compare it to all of our examples. In the end, we will have so many possible ""hits."" Whichever character has the most ""hits"" is likely to be the correct one. Done, we've recognized that image. If you think about it, this is actually very similar to how we humans recognize things. Naturally, many children do not immediately distinguish between couches and love seats. What is the difference many of them ask. There is a bit of a grey area between them, and they have many similarities. Generally, a lot of learning comes by example. After seeing hundreds of couches, thousands of chairs, and hundreds of love-seats, a person soon begins to easily distinguish between them, because they have quite a bit of sample data to compare to. This is even how we read text. A number 5 really does mean nothing to a baby. They only begin to learn what a number 5 is as they are shown it over and over, being told it is ""5."" Eventually, they understand that to be a 5, and they can see 5 in multiple font types and still recognize it to be a 5.

Now that you are pretty much a pro at all other things Matplotlib, it is time to learn how to spread your wings a bit and begin working with geo-plotting on maps, using basemap. Basemap works alongside Matplotlib to allow you to plot via latitude and longitude coordinates. Once you have basemap installed, you can use the following code to quickly show a simple map. This will just render and display a map, but soon we'll be plotting, zooming, and more fun things!

Eventually, multiple web frame works began to appear, and Django became the most popular. There are many others, such as Flask, web2py, and bottle. Each framework has its own characteristics and should be considered depending on your project. Django, Flask, and web2py are all great options. Django is the largest and most supported, so if you happen to learn by example, this might be the best choice. Django also just seems to have more documentation. Flask and web2py are both slightly more basic at their core. web2py doesn't require much at all, which is why many prefer it. Django forces you into having a semi-complex website, where web2py does not. Flask is somewhere in the middle. That said, you can make very simple websites with Django, and very complex websites with web2py. If you intend to have a content-management-driven website with a significant database, then Django should definitely be considered. If you want to go with Django, then this tutorial series might just be for you. In this series, we create a simple blog-like website, do some basic HTML5 design, and show how to add python code in the back ground and display the return of any script. In our case, the return is the outputted Matplotlib graph that our backend script creates. Below is a picture of the finished product.
