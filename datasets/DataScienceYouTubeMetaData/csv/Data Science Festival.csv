Plentiful data, cloud compute, and open source tools means even small teams can do powerful things – in this talk we’ll go through the steps to setup a machine learning pipeline to analyse overhead imagery and discuss the results and lessons learnt. For energy analysis, it is necessary to first deeply understand the distribution of the underlying infrastructure. Only then can the steps to create a representative and useful dataset be taken. There are many different imagery providers and datasets – the strengths and weaknesses of different data sources are discussed along with techniques to pre-process them. Satellite and aerial imagery and geospatial data need some extra steps compared to plain image analysis, but python has several powerful packages like rasterio to handle them. Computer vision CNNs and transfer learning mean training a model on geospatial raster data in a pipeline is reasonably straightforward. This talk will go through the necessary steps for a generic task, and the code will be available. Open source geospatial learning tools like RasterVision can jump-start this kind of project, but come with their own learning curves. Specific lessons learned from two projects, understanding coal power plant output from smoke plumes, and identifying solar PV from aerial imagery will be explained with particular emphasis on data science techniques used. From an initial pilot, understanding the output of coal power plants based on visual band imagery of smoke plumes has led to a significant project supported by a Google AI Impact grant currently underway by WattTime and the Carbon Tracker Initiative.",28,Science & Technology,PT57M47S,3467,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/84la-BGWvno/maxresdefault.jpg,,72,1,0,0,0

While solutions exist to generate poetry and other basic rhymes, simulation of more complex hip-hop styles has remained elusive. Our work first sought to better understand these limitations, by re-imagining the basic form of the rhyme data: As phonemes instead of words. The phonetic representation of any word (funny Greek looking symbols) is an instruction on how to properly pronounce it. Such an approach allows for similarly spelled (but differently pronounced) words to become separate, (e.g. through does NOT rhyme with though, but it DOES rhyme with crew, few, drew etc. since they all end with the phoneme ‘uː’, which is an ‘ew’ sound). Furthermore, modern rapping often rhymes at the syllable rather than word level, (e.g. allowing ‘tiramisu’ to rhyme with ’terror miss you’). This led to the creation of a training corpus, consisting of tens of thousands of rap & hip-hop songs, with each lyric being reduced to its constituent phonemes, and grouped into syllables. The first step was to obtain a phonetic representation for every word. We obtained a dictionary of ~50,000 unique English words and their phonetic representations and used that data to develop a phoneme predictor for all the plural/tense-specific/slang/obscene words used in rap songs. This took the form of a recurrent neural network with bidirectional LSTM layers, and a time distributed output layer (for predicting sequences). After significant experimentation with the training set, encoding/decoding strategies and network architecture modifications, we arrived at a trained network with ~97.5% accuracy. We are satisfied with this since the English language contains certain ambiguities that are a product of historical usage and regional accents. Our results are promising and pave the way for future work using text-to-speech technologies and lyric generation, thus having a valuable place in our larger on-going project; aiming to create a NN that can generate rhymes that retain thematic continuity, adhere to a particular rhyming pattern and to do so in real-time (potentially against a human opponent). We believe that representing the song lyrics as syllables, expressed as sequences of phonemes, will allow us to limit the future work to generating sentences that rhyme, make sense, and include a response to the incoming data. Bio: Ian Ashmore is Senior Data Scientist at Cap-HPI. He earned his PhD. from the University of Leeds in theoretical astrophysics (magnetohydrodynamics) and prior to that had become the first physics undergraduate at Leeds to have their master’s project published in reputable academic journals.

AI applications are starting to become available for a wide range of applications, from on-board data reduction to fine-grained analytics. Agriculture is one of the areas with the largest social impact of this technological revolution, through a two-pronged strategy. Firstly, AI technology is used to replace the typical flat-rate applications of chemicals with targeted applications only to regions of need, thus alleviating the environmental stress caused by intensive farming practices. Secondly, AI is used to substitute agronomic input across the season, something particularly meaningful in parts of the world where access to agronomical input is limited. In this talk, we are going to present in detail the related topics, while also discussing the technology bottlenecks, limitations and future directions.",22,People & Blogs,PT14M27S,867,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-dBpKZTEOE/maxresdefault.jpg,,285,5,1,0,1

Successful deployments make our models available so they can be easily accessed by both internal and external systems, depending on business requirements. Once our ML models are deployed, other systems can send input data to these models and receive back predictions. Only through effective machine learning model deployment can we maximize the business value of the models we build. When we think about data science, we think about how to build machine learning models. We think about which algorithm will be more predictive, how to engineer our features and which variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, the “last mile” of planning how to use the models in production is often neglected, despite its critical importance. Machine learning systems have all the usual challenges of software development, combined with additional data science-specific challenges, which means that deployments and system architecture require careful planning. This is a realisation that many individuals and organisations make when it is too late. In this talk, we will discuss the steps and challenges involved in putting a machine learning model into production.

The majority of an organisation fail to create business value from their investments in data. Most implementations are either high cost IT projects, local applications that are not built to scale for production workflows or laptop data insight projects that never impact customers. The key to adding value is to adapt and borrow principles from Agile, Lean and Dev Ops. However, Agile Data Science is not just about shipping working machine learning models, but starts with better alignment of data science with the rest of the organisation and its goals. This presentation will outline practical solutions to increasing the velocity of value creation including: prioritisation, new processes for an end-to-end data lifecycle, people and organisation changes to improve collaboration, tools and solution architectures to reduce data friction.

Recommender systems are paramount for e-business companies. There is an increasing need to take into account all user information to provide the best, most tailored products. One important element is the content that the user actually sees: the visual of the product. In this talk, we will describe how Dataiku improved an e-business vacation retailer recommender system using the content of images. We’ll explain how to leverage open datasets and pre-trained deep learning models to derive user preference information.

Bots usually have a number of pre-programmed answers that can only be given to very specifically worded questions. If there is input that was not anticipated by the authors, the answers become useless. Recent advances in deep learning have made it feasible to create software that learns to reply on its own by looking at historical conversations. A learning conversation machine can answer user queries significantly more flexibly, and can constantly improve and refine its internal structure from user feedback. In this talk, Pyry will cover the basics of how one can build self-learning conversation systems.",22,People & Blogs,PT15M,900,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_JZFMfahQs/maxresdefault.jpg,,278,1,0,0,0
