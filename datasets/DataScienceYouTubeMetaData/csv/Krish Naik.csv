So far, in our experience while providing training for data science and while interviewing candidates, we have observed that one of the things which is most lacking is the intuition and experience to build an end to end machine learning pipeline and architecture. Hence, we are launching this initiative to discuss various architectures catering to almost all the software industry domains. Here, we will drill down to the nitty-gritty of building a software solution from scratch and discuss various ways to make it scalable and robust. Moreover, we’ll also talk about building your resumes for data science job roles based on your experience and the industry domain that you work in.

Momentum or SGD with momentum is method which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is one of the most popular optimization algorithms and many state-of-the-art models are trained using it.

The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors. k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor. References : Jose Portilla Project Implementation.
