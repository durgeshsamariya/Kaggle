However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any ""weak learner"", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm. ALSO NOTE: There is a minor error at 15:47. It should be R_jm, not R_ij. Also, there are minor errors at 16:18 and 24:15. At 16:18, the leaf in the script is R_1,2 and it should be R_2,1.

Here, take this cup have a drink from the well Then lend me your ear I’ve a story to tell Not long ago there was a castle and a prince And a maiden so fair all surrounded by a fence Inside those walls the gardens grew lush and green But the walls themselves were a sight so obscene A head on each post they were a warning to us all To keep on our side not to question the wall A knight from our side saw the maiden from afar (And) he was drawn to the fence like a moth to a star So he climbed up the wall and made his way across the lawn But the prince acted fast and stabbed the knight before the dawn So look over there, you’ll see his head upon a post And this is what he said before he gave up the ghost “Alas, sweet revenge won’t be a story I can tell but I saw the maiden put poison in the well.” If you'd like to support StatQuest, please consider...

The song had two sources of inspiration: #1: A Gillian Welch song called ""Look at Miss Ohio"", that has the lines: Oh me oh my oh Look at Miss Ohio She’s a running around with her rag-top down She says I wanna do right but not right now ...anyway - I was biking home from work and I was standing at the intersection of Henderson and Rosemary and I thought of that song and I started to sing about ""Miss North Carolina"" as if she were some sort of trouble maker. From there it turned into ""I miss Carolina, when am I gonna head back home"" - a song about a North Carolina exile that wants to come home. So, that was inspiration #1. #2 Once I had this idea of ""I miss Carolina"", I started to think about all the political rabble rousing that's going on in the state - and this was before the Silent Sam thing happened (a bunch of people knocked over Silent Sam a few weeks ago) - they've got these crazy state constitutional amendments that are coming out of no where that we are supposed to vote on. One of them declares that ""hunting and fishing will be the primary means for managing fish and wildlife populations"". Stupid stuff that seems like old folk trying to make it harder to young folk to get anything done in the state. So then the song went back to ""Miss Carolina"" - she being the true spirit of the state - she's gone and left us all covered in pretty weeds, but still weeds. NOTE: I specifically used the antiquated term ""Miss"" instead of the more modern ""Ms"" because ""Miss"" is still used for beauty pageants - when the state picks the woman who most embodies the ""spirit"" of the state - she's beautiful, but also smart, caring and determined to change the world for the better. She's the one that's gone and we need her back. If you'd like to support StatQuest, please consider... Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/statquest ...or...

The new version corrects two small errors listed below: See: https://youtu.be/sQ870aTKqiM Last time we talked about how to create, use and evaluate random forests. Now it's time to see how they can deal with missing data and how they can be used to cluster samples, even when the data comes from all kinds of crazy sources. NOTE: At 10:22 I overlooked one step. In this case, you plug in the most common value/median value for all observations in the training dataset that have that same category as the new copy that you created. For example, we created two new copies of the observation: one with with heart disease and one without heart disease. Now, for the new copy with heart disease, we plug in the most common value from the observations in the training dataset that have heart disease. For the new copy without heart disease, we plug in the most common value from the observations in the training dataset that do not have heart disease. We can then use the iterative method to refine the guess if we want, or we can just run those two copies down the tree and use the classification from the copy that got the most correct votes.

For example, you might collect some data and wonder if it is normally distributed. A QQ plot will help you answer that question. You can also use QQ plots to compare to different datasets that you collected to determine if their distributions are comparable. This video shows you how to do both things. NOTE: At 4:35, the Uniform Distribution has one extra quantile and at 5:30 I should have said that Quartiles divide the data into 4 parts. NOTE: The data in this video are measures of gene expression. If ""gene expression"" doesn't mean anything to you, just imagine that the data represents how tall a bunch of people are, or how much they weigh. Then consider the y-axis to be the height or weight of the people, and the x-axis just represents all of the data you collected on a single day. In this case, all of the data were collected on the same day, so they form a single column.
