With that said, many introductory courses teach students that they can conclude that we Accept Ho. Please be aware of the nuance regardless of how you choose to phrase the conclusion. Reject Ho, however, is a stronger statement that we can justifiably make using the laws of probability and the level of significance of the test. When we Reject Ho we are concluding that there is enough evidence against Ho with the state level of significance used. We are willing to accept the chance of making a Type I Error, but we are very clear about the probability of its occurrence, i.e., it is equal to alpha (at least nominally).",27,Education,PT14M10S,850,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmHFFFpOVZs/maxresdefault.jpg,1,418800,2958,81,0,177
