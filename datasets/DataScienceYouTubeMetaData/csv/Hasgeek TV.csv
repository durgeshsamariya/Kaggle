Our goal is to test ways to nudge users to make privacy conscious decisions and whether adopting user-centric privacy practices gives businesses a competitive advantage. We tested our nudges - like privacy rating meter and cool down period - in an online experiment against a control group with the aim to see impact on comprehension of the privacy policy and the willingness to share data. In the session, the IntAct team will share the results from our experiments. We will further dive into the possibilities these findings present for regulators, businesses and service providers to improve privacy practices and help build a stronger data privacy environment in developing economies.

Purescript is a pure functional language which compiles to Javascript and has support for pretty advanced features that a programmer can expect, like higher kinded types, poly kinded types, row polymorphism, and good type inference. It interops seamlessly with Javascript and can be used to write concise, elegant and expressive code which can run on any JS engine. The ideas used in the language are very similar to Haskell, another pure functional language. It doesn’t have a runtime and the generated JS code is very clear and is easy to look at and debug. Purescript helps prevent a huge class of run time bugs. The type system is very strong and aids type inference and also code suggestion. So it helps manage huge codebases by separating effectful code from pure code and keeps effects at its edges and very minimal.

As a leader in Agriculture Biotechnology industry, Bayer tests hundreds of genes every year for insecticidal activity in their proprietary pipeline to develop next generation of insect control solutions. Identification and nomination insecticidal proteins using traditional methods like blast and structure similarity have some drawbacks because of which more than 90% of the nominated proteins end up displaying no or less activity against insects. The testing of these proteins consumes enormous amount of time and resource. So we adopted machine learning (ML) approach to identify these proteins. We generated numerous features for more than 5000 amino acid sequences using a Python toolkit, iFeature, developed by Chen et al, in 2018 and built ML models to identify proteins with insecticidal activity. Proteins identified using this method are tested in the pipeline to check their efficacy against insect pests. Challenges faced while building the model and methods to overcome those challenges are discussed in this presentation. The information in this presentation can be helpful for building models for bio-medical research (example cancer-related proteins, proteins in age-related diseases), agriculture and other domains. Dr. Karnam Vasudeva Rao is presently working as Senior Scientist-Data Science, Bayer, Bengaluru, India since 2009. Prior to this Vasu has pursued his PhD from Max-Planck Institute For Biochemistry, Munich, Germany. He has enormous experience working in research organizations in India and abroad.

This unfortunate “orientalisation” has resulted in a tendency to keep science at an arm’s length from the kitchen. It has also given rise to a ton of pseudo-scientific misconceptions about modern cooking methods and a distinct preference for freshly cooked food prepared from scratch that involves a ton of manual labour (usually by women). As is the case with Indian classical music, there is also a relative lack of accurate archival or documentation about cooking techniques and ingredients, thus leaving the average home cook at the mercy of what I call the “tyranny of the authentic recipe”. In this talk, speaker Krish Ashok, will focus on some of the more egregious misconceptions that are common in Indian kitchens and address them through the lens of food science.

In this talk, speaker Willem Pienaar explains how GO-JEK, Indonesia’s first billion-dollar startup, unlocked insights in AI by building a feature store called Feast, and some of the lessons they learned along the way. Features are at the heart of what makes these machine learning systems effective. However, many challenges still exist in the feature lifecycle. Developing features from big data is often an engineering heavy task, with challenges in both the scaling of data processes and the serving of features in production systems. Teams also face challenges in enabling discovery, reducing duplication, improving understanding, and providing standardization of features throughout organizations. Willem explains the need for features at organizations like GO-JEK and discusses the challenges faced in creating, managing, and serving them in production. He describes how in partnership with Google, GO-JEK designed and built a feature store called Feast to address these challenges and explore their motivations, the lessons they learned along the way, and the impact the feature store had on GO-JEK. He also talks about the open source plans for Feast and the roadmap going forward.

Unfortunately, the foundations of popular tensor libraries (NumPy, tensorflow, PyTorch, etc) are hardly robust. For e.g., tensor broadcasting rules are adhoc, and may cause surprising bugs. Further, the tensor library APIs expose low-level memory models to developers, forcing them to continuously translate between their high-level mental models of data and low-level memory models. The absence of systematic ways to track shapes and perform ‘semantic’ transformations, forces them to guess the latent tensor shapes forever or add adhoc ‘shape comments’. In this talk, speaker Nishant Sinha - independent researcher and consultant at OffNote Labs - explains that developers trying to write deep learning programs/architectures from scratch or even trying to tweak existing model repositories and pre-trained models, are exposed to endless, unwanted ‘tensor’ misery.

Whenever there is uncertainty, there is a tool that can help you get a better estimate of that state. It is called a Kalman Filter, named after an American mathematician, Rudolf Kalman. Kalman Filters, or the Linear Quadratic Estimator, is a powerful tool for estimating state in the presence of unreliable or uncertain data. With applications in a multitude of fields ranging from finance, economics, marketing, sports to vehicle control, Robotics, signal processing and biology, it combines data over time resulting in a much better performance than simply using the data present at the current moment. Speaker Naman Kumar - a Robotics engineer - elaborates on Kalman Filters and the intuition underlying Kalman Filters.

Since everything is converted to native DOM API calls and not shipping a runtime to the user, apps built with Svelte are faster than those shipped with a runtime (like React or Vue). Svelte also brings in built-in, first-class support for CSS animations and transitions. Therefore developers don’t need to import other libraries into their app to get transitions working.

Phishing is a well-known, computer-based, social engineering technique. Attackers use disguised emails as a weapon to target large companies. Numerous fake websites have been developed to mimic trusted websites, with the aim of stealing financial assets from users and organizations. With the huge number of phishing emails received every day, companies are not able to detect all of them. That is why new techniques and safeguards are needed to defend against phishing. In the layered-security model, this is the next level of security control to deal with those emails that even manage to evade spam filtering gateway & also block undesired action when a user clicks on a malicious link. Machine learning (ML) is a popular tool for data analysis and recently has shown promising results in combating phishing.

There are over 300 thousand restaurants on the platform with a total of over 16 million dishes between them. Over two-thirds of those who order food online using GO-FOOD do so by utilising text search. While improving ranking is an extremely important part of enhancing the search experience, understanding that query helps give the searcher exactly what they’re looking for. The semantic neighbours of the query itself become the focus of the search process: after all, if I don’t understand what you’re trying to ask for, how will I give you what you want? Query Understanding: What & Why This is where Query Understanding comes into the picture: it’s about using NLP to correctly identify the search intent behind the query and return more relevant search results. GO-FOOD uses the ElasticSearch stack, which results in only exact text matches and/or fuzzy matches. We wanted to create a holistic search experience that not only personalised search results, but also retrieved restaurants and dishes that were more relevant to what the user was looking for. In the duration of this talk, you will learn about how we are taking advantage of word embeddings to build a Query Understanding Engine that is holistically designed to make the customer’s experience as smooth as possible. I will go over the techniques we used to build each component of the engine, the data and algorithmic challenges we faced and how we solved each problem we came across. Learning Objectives The primary objective of the talk is for you to learn why deriving query semantics is essential to building a great search engine, and how you can go about building a Query Semantics Engine. You will learn about how to: Take advantage of word embeddings for building an intelligent search engine Deal with data challenges Choose from various metrics when evaluating performance of a Search Engine I will walk you through the journey of how we chose the solution we have, and why it made the most sense in our context.

There are 23 official and much more unofficial languages prevalently used in day-to-day conversations. Unfortunately, information dissemination to the low resource languages get difficult because of the geo-spatial distances.

However, their efficacy on practical domain-specific data, like product titles, is often subpar due to several challenges - 1) labeled data is scarce or unavailable; 2) noise in the form of spelling errors, missing tokens, abbreviations etc.; 3) variance in structure (as it is not a natural language, hence no grammar); 4) manual labelling is costly. In this talk, I will talk about how at Clustr, we leveraged an existing sparse Knowledge Graph to generate a set of weak labeled seed data and used it to bootstrap a deep Recurrent Neural Network-based sequence labelling model. Further, we build upon the concepts of Active Learning to iteratively train our model with minimal amount of manual labelling. The key takeaways of the talk would be 1) how to deal with similar problems with availability of training data (even with different category of data e.g. images, sensor data etc.), 2) understanding why Deep neural network architecture can generalise very easily if used correctly; and 3) we would describe how active learning is a promising paradigm in building practical machine learning-based solutions to domain-specific problems riddled with scare labeled data IIT Roorkee Grad.

This talk introduces RedisAI, a joint effort by [tensor]werk and RedisLabs. RedisAI is a Redis module that adds tensors & graphs as Redis data types, enabling execution of deep learning graphs on the CPU and GPU using multiple backends (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNXRuntime) simultaneously, while exposing a full tensor API for scripting. In this talk, we will demonstrate deploying a deep learning model to production in a highly available environment and lay down the roadmap towards 1.0. Year 2018 was the year of model servers. There were numeroius initiatives for building a reliable, interoperable deep learning deployment toolkits but so far we don’t have an easy tool that can reliably handle the deep learning models from all the frameworks. With the advent of Redis modules and the availability of C APIs for the major deep learning frameworks, it is now possible to turn Redis into a reliable runtime for deep learning workloads, providing a simple solution for a model serving microservice. In this talk we will introduce RedisAI, a joint effort by [tensor]werk and RedisLabs that introduces tensors and graphs as new Redis data types and allows to execute graphs over tensors using multiple backends (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNXRuntime), both on the CPU and GPU. The module also supports scripting with TorchScript, which provides a Python-like tensor language that can be used to facilitate pre- and post-processing operations, like input shaping or output ensembling. In addition, thanks to its support for the ONNX standard, including ONNX-ML, RedisAI is not strictly limited to deep learning, but it offers support for general machine learning algorithms. In this talk, we will demonstrate a full journey from training a model to deploying to production in a highly available environment.

Or, how we brought down the latency in processing of our data to half. Zapr has profiled millions of users for tv consumption and in part we had to build our data processing pipeline from scratch. Initially, We started off doing it all the wrong way first by adding fields over time. As a results it came to a point where it was impossible to manage or keep track of fields that were present in data. Core concept in this talk is around how we should model the data flowing in the pipelines and the advantages it gives both from a Business as well as a technical perspective.

Today marketers are able to track the smallest of digital footprint like scrolls on mobile or web apps. Armed with the digital trove of user behavior data, marketers are trying to nudge and retain their users across the customer lifecycle. But, why are conversions per campaign in low single digits? Why does an app lose 90% of the newly acquired users in the first month? A marketer of a medium sized app (MAU ~ 20,000 and 50 events per user per month) has to analyze atleast 1 million data points monthly. In order to be agile, marketers tend to cut corners and take sub-optimal data driven decisions. As a result, conversions rates are poor. A sub 1% conversion rate is quite common i.e. 99 users out of 100 are not interested in the app’s messaging. This not only means that the marketer has poorly allocated the resources and runs the risk of underachieving the target KPIs but also antagonize the user experience which could result in churn or uninstalls. CleverTap is a leading Customer Lifecycle Management and Engagement Platform which help apps retain their users for life. The solutions that we develop have to be best-in class, generic (usable by any app) and highly actionable. This talk will discuss our approach to solve 2 keys issues faced by marketers: Identify that elusive segment that gives the maximum ROI based on pre-defined goal within a pre- defined time Hyper personalized messages that resonate with their users resulting in increased conversions The key takeaway for the audience is the use of temporal user behavior to create: Dynamic User Clusters Recommender Engine An Investment Banker by accident and a Data Scientist by choice, Jacob has successfully transitioned from the world of finance to the world of nerds in analytics.

Since being in a consumer market where user experience is the the key, we had to rely heavily on data from Day 1 of game/product launches. This is the reason we actually built our data infrastructure in parallel to games/products and had it ready for production usage from begining itself. We relied heavily on ready-to-use systems but at the same time had to be cost sensitive being a startup. Setting up whole data-lake and heavy duty hdfs cluster was ruled out due to cost and maintenance overhead. We setup a lightweight data collection pipline to central queues which is then ingested in realtime to our warehouse of choice Redshift (reason being ease-of-use). Also, scaling such a system has its cost overheads when your product grows. So we had to design data retention and data querying capabilities such that we aren’t paying hefty bills as well as aren’t being limited in terms of querying real-time data from our users. I am Kumar Puspesh, CTO and Co-Founder of Moonfrog, India’s top mobile gaming company. We had to design a large scale data infrastructre from day 1 of our company to cater to our product needs. Having a cost sensitive as well as scalable approach helped us achieve large scale as a gaming company in India in short amount of time.

Deployment is another issue; microservices? Monilithic? Docker? What about testing? And security? They are a lot of questions. With this conversation (rather than a “talk”), I will try to justify the good and the bad use-case of each of the technologies. By the end of this talk, the attendees should have a nice grasp on the pros and the cons of some of the most popular libraries, design patterns and mechanisms in the Node.js/JS world and when should they use which. In my career as a JavaScript developer and backend architect, oftentimes our teams have faced these age-old questions and have opted to choose whichever was the easiest. While good for RAD/MVP, every technology has its side-effects which are, more often than not, misunderstood or misconstrued. Further, a talk with just a bunch of slides gets boring really fast. I try to combine experience, story-telling and technology (and some humor) to keep the audience engaged while making sure that they learn as much as they possible can.

Well, we evaluated, compared and decided to build a self managed ELK stack because none of them fit our requirements. In this session, we will walk through various design choices we made to have a high performing log analytics cluster, aggressively optimized for cost and support for infinite data scale without exponentially increasing cost. If you are planning on setting up or re-looking at your log analytics, this could be interesting to you. Business Requirements/Use Cases - Log analysis platform (Application, Web-Server, Database logs) - Data Ingestion rate: ~300GB/day - Frequently accessed data: last 8 days - Infrequently accessed data: 82 days (90 - 8 days) - Uptime: 99.90 - Hot Retention period: 90 days - Cold Retention period: 90 days (with potential to increase) - Cost effective solution Areas of optimization - Application - Infrastructure Cost Optimization - Replica counts and its impacts - How to run ELK on Spot instances correctly. - EBS Costs can be high, how to set up Hot / Cold data storage - Auto Scaling - On-demand ELK Cluster Infinite Data Retention - How to setup S3 as a hot backup - Recover on Demand Numbers/Tradeoffs - Cost/GB data ingested - Trade-offs made - DR mechanisms Conclusion - Building a log analytics is not rocket science. But it can be painfully iterative if you are not aware of the options. Be aware of the trade-offs you are OK making and you can roll out a solution specifically optimized for that.

In this talk, we will touch base on the approaches as well as key decisions we took to ensure we have security in place from day 1 of our product launch. To keep understanding simple, I have segmented security into 3 following buckets A cloud approach A compliance approach A product approach A cloud approach: Most of our founding team members were well versed with a public cloud (AWS), hence, this was a no brainer decision to adapt an AWS heavy infrastructure. Challenges(Security): Due diligence of shared responsibility: All managed workloads would need to have a policy defined. E.g. An IAM role must not have an excess permissions or an admin user should not be able to delete a running ECS cluster. Lifecycle of workloads/resources: E.g. Security groups for enabling temporary access across AWS resource needs to be revoked asap. Secret/Key Management: E.g, Because secrets are not meant to be hardcoded. Incident Response: E.g. Bitcion miner on a hacked EC2. Approach: Least Principle - OKTA as SSO on separate AWS accounts(dev,stage,prod,PCI, central) with distinguished user groups. Continuous AWS Monitoring - https://www.cloudconformity.com/conformity-rules/ AWS Guardduty - Monitors Cloudtrail, VPC Flow logs and Route53 logs - SNS to Email for all alerts. A Compliance Approach: Fintech is regulated business and industry standards are its consequence. During the first month of our product launch, we were required to become compliant to NPCI guidelines for a UPI launch. Followed by RBI’s data localization requirement(SAR) and then ISO 27001:2013 Challenges: Onboarding independent auditors to the concept of credit card bill payments. Onboarding consultants to view product/business from a different angle. Creating a process oriented culture to adhere to various compliance requirements. A Product Approach: Our founder wanted our product to be as secure before we launch. Challenges: Dealing with rapid code+design changes. Defensive versus offensive. Proposing secure solutions for end user application flow. Approach: Keeping track of changes in every alpha build. Sit next to developer and start with a simple code review. Need not be a tool based approach, for every API call, check the corresponding codebase and think what could go wrong. Too many tools and framework to attack. Think on how to make every attack difficult. E.g. SSL Pinning, Code obfuscation( Proguard followed by Dexguard) Review all application flow, look at application having user inputs. E.g. OTP flow in our app. Himanshu is currently repsponsible for overall security at CRED. He has spend most of his career into fintech domain at GrabPay, Flipkart, PayPal in building in-house security platforms and products, hence, his domain expertise.

Keeping these 3 factors in mind, we proceed to understand the undermentioned use cases. Observability: Intent: Reliability. - Metric Collection: We will discuss on how we were able to collect metrics from closely guarded systems, with no access to the internet by using a reverse hole punching mechanism. - Scalable Storage: We started off by using Postgres as our database for storing metrics. Soon enough we hit a situation where the rate of ingestion almost exponentially filled up our storage. We will discuss on how we designed this solution to push metrics to multiple storage systems without affecting existing deployments. - Proactive Alerting: Observability is more than just metrics collection. We will walk through certain use cases which helped us analyse traffic load to adjust resource allocation, keep a track of all error codes sent by upstream, and detect slowness vs disconnection across networks. Shared storage: Intent: Reliability. We deal with deployments in closely guarded systems where we don’t have control over the infrastructure. We will discuss how we utilized existing tooling to share data between services deployed across vlans. Network accessibility: Intent: Cost-Reduction and Speed - Proxies: Network accessibility would mean restricting access to certain sources. The exercise of whitelisting source addresses is neither economical nor fast when it comes to closely guarded systems. With the use of a transparent proxy we were able to manage access easily. We will discuss how Squid proxy would hijack a 429 error with a 503, leading to temporary denial of access to the upstream service. - DNS: We will discuss 2 war stories with respect to DNS - one where DNS resolution failed randomly and the other where DNS lookup limit was reached when too many services were accessing our central monitoring solution in a short span of time. - File sharing: Any deployment in a closely guarded environment would mean us having to upload files to the destination manually. We resolved this situation by implementing a small service which made file access easy across such environments. - Topology mapping: Constant manual intervention was needed to check if x ports were opened cross y systems in z vlans. We discuss the solutioning of how we automated this task. Infrastructure Management: Intent: Reliability and Speed. Infrastructure is the entrypoint to deploy code to production. While cloud providers do make this task easy, there are deeper problems we had to address, such as - versioning, locking access to concurrent updation of resources and enabling webhooks. We developed a tool called Tessellate to do just this. With an intent to give more power to product teams to bring up their own infrastructure without having to build the skill set, we designed a tool called Escher which would take a YAML file as an input and provide a fully baked infrastructure to the user. Escher also made automating workflows easier alongside our orchestrator service. Infosec: Authorization and Traceability: Intent: Cost-Reduction and Reliability. Any activity performed by the SRE team, be it service deployment, PR merge or infrastructure improvement, had to be tracked to ensure production systems were reliably maintained. We built multiple authentication and authorization workflows around each of these use cases. These simple solutions enabled us to confidently allow deployments to take place. We discuss solutions such as ACL on job scheduling, 2FA authentication for service deployments and LDAP for traceability. Conclusion: The core belief of an SRE team is to solve problems for the larger good and not restrict ourselves to the problem at hand. Every single tool we use was solutioned keeping this intent in mind. Each solution was a step towards better debuggability and accessibility to the issues faced in production, and each of these solutions made our on-call shifts manageable. The key takeaway from this talk would be to follow the same approach and taking a step back and thinking twice before doing something manually, thinking whether this problem is repeatable, reusable and can be automated. - Talina is a software engineer @ Trusting Social.

This involves intensive database operations. We use RDS MySQL databases, and it’s really easy and addictive to scale up RDS., and that’s what we have been doing so far. We are already at db.m4.4xlarge. We have a plethora of services running in our infrastructure and making huge number of queries to our databases. There are times when our RDS instances gets bombarded with huge number of connections and it leads to high CPU & memory usage, thereby, degrading RDS performance, bringing our application to its knees. In our applications (Django app), we already had implemented database connection pooling to alleviate this issue, however, Django’s connection pooling is just limited to a single process, and does not work across multiple processes and servers. This is when, we started looking into database connection pooling and proxy solutions, in order to achieve 10x scale without any fundamental changes and keeping costs low.

Everyone would get a walkthrough on though how glamourous one side for a bug bounty hunter is with all fancy rewards/recognition and in a time where bug bounty profile is equivalent to developers GitHub profile in a CV to how hard it is for an organization to decide on whether to have a program like this or not. Finding the way forward is hard as having one has it’s own problem and not having one has it’s own repurcursion. And also glimpse into what challenges pop up while we go down the path of having one from aligning different teams(finance/legal/PR/engineering etc.) across the organization. In a nutshell, the aim is to deliver on what point to consider in the timeline of an organisation to have a bug bounty program and understand the pros and cons of it. Agenda of this talk is to give a glimpse into the actual world of bug bounty and just not from what we read in news. These will be some points of discussion to paint a complete picture for the audience: -Introduction and benefits of having a bug bounty program -Discuss on would it make sense to have a bug bounty program or can we live without it -What take do leadership has on bug bounty, their concerns, and expectations -What could go wrong if we dont even bother -When is the right time in the timeline of an organization to have open connect with security researchers -What kind of organizations need such program or how do we decide it for my non-IT organization -What platform make sense? Should we buy or build our own -Why problem would pop up while building a platform vs drawbacks on signing up on a platform -What all process needs to put in place across the organization to have a successful one -What is bare minimum automation we need to have to scale up to all bugs we receive -How do different teams react to it like the legal team(policies), finance team, PR team etc. -What are the logistic problem that shows up towards the launch -Do’s and Do not’s of a bug bounty program -My take on what it takes to run a successful bug bounty program Speaker bio Shadab has led Black Ops teams err..

Such assets or information can cause catastrophic damage to the organization, unless identified and remediated. Examples of such data could be a legacy host running unauthenticated mysql, or a list of confidential subdomains leaking via Certificate Transparency, an anonymous read-only bucket serving images along with backup.tar, etc. Since such issues can allow any attacker to compromise organization’s perimeter security, Security Teams should keep a very close eye on what information (about the organization) is being leaked out on the Surface as well as the Dark web.

Over the last couple of decades, thought leaders have strongly opposed manufacturer-centric strategies and argued the case of Open Source and Open Standards. This ultimately led to the success of Linux and Open Source we have today. But now, two decades later, the IT industry is in upheaval again: All three major cloud providers have been pushing their serverless solutions in order to lure customers into a new form of vendor lock-in. And they succeeded: The number of serverless deployments has already surpassed those of container based ones. “So this is how liberty dies … with thunderous applause” I think there is no time to waste, to remind ourselves about Open Standards, their value to our industry, and why it is worth to fight for them to survive. Open Standards go beyond the boundaries of development and operation. They are the foundation of a barrier free interoperability and independent communications. The lecture aims to inspire the connection between both worlds and paradigms for a modern and flexible application infrastructure. All the technical diversity we enjoy in our industry is the result of internal evangelism 20 yers ago.

As a cluster admin, to protect interests of other users, you would want some measure to lock down users to their own constrained environment. Pod Security Policy can help achieve exactly that. It is your first line of defense against uncontained pods. This presentation will highlight various benefits of locking down the workloads using PSP & striking the right balance of security vs usability. Hence bringing in the security mindset while developing & deploying applications. By the end of the presentation users will be convinced to use PSP as their one of the default security measures. This talk will start with current state of Kubernetes security and how folks are setting up their clusters. How folks are using shortcuts to get around changing their old bad practices. The talk will explain folks what’s worst that can happen if they keep using those bad practices. Specially in the multi-tenant setup this can lead to massive breakouts. The above topics are there to create a ground for folks to appreciate the security feature of Kubernetes Pod Security Policy. We then come to core of the talk this is where I will explain what Pod Security Policy is and how it can help in hardening the cluster. I will explain all the supported features that PSP has and what feature stops what kind of attack vector in a multi-tenant untrusted environment. Also I will explain the benefits of having secure & hardened clusters from the development phase itself and how it helps you understand and catch the issues that you might encounter only while deploying on production.

In the last 8-12 years, political and economic critiques from the Left, Right, centrist ideologies have tried to shape popular (and not-so-popular) opinions about Aadhar. In a conversation with Reetika Khera on Wednesday, 3 April at HasGeek House, we will: Examine the discourse around Aadhar that the various critiques have built in the last five years. What do these critiques see and oversee – and therefore, what are the questions that we, as concerned individuals, need to ask about Aadhar? How do we equip ourselves – and therefore what do we need to see – to ask the right questions? What role do communities have to play in reviewing and critiquing large-scale infrastructure projects such as Aadhar, which impact several lives and groups of citizens? What are the avenues of participation for communities, especially when decisions are either made via opaque processes or behind 13 feet walls?

But once I delved into the challenges and areas of improvement, I found it to be quite challenging. EXIF, resampling, encoding to other formats all on the client !!! And doing all of this while keeping the main thread free, thats the challenge I’m solving. Bonus: some WebAssembly magic too !! I wanted the process of uploading images on the web to be as good as native in terms of capability and smooth/performant as well. Based on our requirements, when we upload an image, the application was supposed to show a thumbnail which should take into account the EXIF orientation factor so that the thumbnail is shown in thr correct orientation. The next big challenge was to reduce the overall upload size during submitting the file to the server. Here we resorted to a Hermite resample filter that allowed us to further reduce the payload size. Since a user could upload maximum of 5 images in one go, we wanted to keep the main thread as free as possible so all of the above-mentioned tasks actually run in a worker. Using transferrables to reduce the time invokved in an othetwise structure clone postMessage was another area of investment. Moving all work into. a worker gave us the opportunity to work on the new amazing OffscreenCanvas API which enabled us to move all computations to the worker thread. Finally a final optimisation (WIP) is to encode our images to webp format to check if the payload size could be further reduced.

Understand how architecture and workflows affect team throughputs in terms of timeline and quality. 2. Understand how key decisions in design and tooling affect various components during development, testing and maintenance. 3. Create workflows that helps remove uncertainty and promote desirable qualitative and quantitative attributes during development. Target audience, Intermediate and advanced app developers, team leads, engineering managers and architects. Software development itself is a practice that is filled with entropy. Even though there are factors in software development that are beyond our control, there are quite a few parameters that can be controlled and tuned. One of the ways to maximise predictability in software projects is to reduce the number of unknowns. Most teams start with an architecture that sets expectations to a degree. How can we push this even further? What if we can build a degree of predictability on how software is built by individuals? What if we could extrapolate the same ideas to a team and across several teams? This talk focuses on how various architectures (imperative and functional) influence individual and team throughput during development and maintenance. We’ll acknowledge how software development is a very creative profession but can also withdraw inspiring ideas from efficient systems like turn-key businesses and production lines that can help build software faster and better. We’ll focus on how the choice of architecture and tooling affect various phases of development. Once we gain an understanding of the architecture, we’ll create and tune a workflow by sequencing activities, establishing processes and building custom tooling around it.

ConstraintLayout(CL) has been in beta development for over 3 years, stable version released just over a year ago. ConstraintLayout allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy. In this talk, I will walk you through the benefits of ConstraintLayout. Animation using CL. We will also look at the Layout Editor for CL. What is this talk about? ConstraintLayout implementation is similar to RelativeLayout, a more powerful and flat view implementation. ConstraintLayout children position based on the constraints of a child to its parent layout or another child, make the view hierarchy flat. We will talk about how constraint layouts reduces the time taken to create a complex layout, reduce developer time and add easy animations. We will also briefly look into MotionLayout.

Unlike write once run everywhere, Multiplatform offers a unique space of reusability and formalization of code across platforms and also removes the dependency on custom VMs or runtime. Modern apps are built on top of abstractions and architectures which make sure code-bases remain mature, testable and error free. They on the other hand also introduce a lot of boilerplate code. This presents an opportunity for code reuse with the help of Kotlin multiplatform. Through this talk, we’ll see how can harness the power of Kotlin Multiplatform to create apps using architectures such as MVP, MVI etc and use Kotlin native to build an abstraction layer across platforms. We’ll also go through the usage of various multiplatform libraries for database and network management. - A brief introduction to kotlin multiplatform - Using various architectures such as MVP/MVI to create a multiplatform app for Android and iOS. - Designing a common layer for storage and networking operations - Using available multiplatform libraries such as SQLDelight, ktor - Developing your own multiplatform library Jitin works as an Android Engineer at GO-JEK, India where he works on aligning design and development as part of UX engineering.

But how can we make sure that the key features the user uses do not stop working with every new deployment? How can we get confidence that when refactoring code the existing feature still works as expected? This talk I am going to share with you my experience of dealing with these in React Native by moving towards TDD. Also how writing unit and e2e tests helped me write better code and build beautiful apps. I will start with a story on how difficult it was to test when there were no tests in the codebase and manually testing everything was so tedious Many people had motivated me to move towards TDD and getting chance to work with people who encourage testing in the codebase helped me to move towards it I started with writing unit tests using Jest is used by Facebook, and as per my experience unit test helps in improving your code architecture and helps you write better code Showing the examples for the same to understand it better When the feature development is done to test it we used detox with Cucumber to write e2e tests This greatly helped us in BDD and automate tests saved time to manually tests everything Showing the example of the same Thus writing tests helped in refactoring with confidence as if any other developer is changing the code running tests provide information if the previous feature working as expected Preeti is a programmer at heart, with over 4+ years on mobile.

And in addition to the usual complexities (logic, database, testing), you are also asked to deliver on a rich user experience that involves custom animations. Not only that, you are also responsible of building the app for both the Android and iOS platforms. As an employee to a company, you are going to cry back home because building the same application twice with the exactly same complexities isn’t a fun and rewarding job. But as a freelancer, you are going to celebrate the job, because longer work hours mean more money no matter how repetitive the task is. But then your client asks you to build the mobile app in Flutter, and that is where the nightmare for freelancers begin. Building the application in Flutter means, you may still have to work in your original hourly rate but unfortunately, you can deliver the project in almost one-third of the original estimation, create almost perfect animations in hours instead of days, and in addition to all that tragedy, you also get the perfectly similar iOS app for free. Welcome to Flutter. A godsent and a curse to freelancers. In this talk, I narrate my story of moving from native Android to Flutter and demonstrate how building apps with Flutter is so much easier, faster and more efficient than native Android. This talk is intended for a beginner/intermediate audience that has some experience with mobile app development but is not necessarily familiar with Flutter, Dart or Android/iOS programming. I will start the talk with my story of moving from native Android to Flutter. Then I will give a brief introduction to Flutter for the beginners in the audience. Then the main part of the talk will comprise of a comparison between Android and Flutter code. I will introduce 5+ examples of features or components that can be build on both native Android and Flutter and demonstrate how Flutter wins the race everytime in the race for speed of development, LOC, and efficiency. I will finally conclude how Flutter is a godsent and a curse both to mobile developers, specially freelancers.

Timely delivery is often a critical deciding factor for the ever-impatient customers to choose service A over service B. Hence, operations/logistic team is the key enabler here. The attrition rate in large front-line teams is high, close to 75 percent annually. Yet most companies have aggressive growth targets, necessitating recruitment of high volumes of workers constantly. High-growth companies in this domain like Zomato and Swiggy, which are trying to grow by 50-60 percent by the end of 2018, need to recruit tens of thousands of delivery boys every month. At Vahan, we have developed an AI-driven virtual assistant that helps logistics companies scale and automate their hiring process by leveraging the common addiction of messaging applications like WhatsApp and FB messenger. In this talk, I will cover in detail how we developed a complete data collection and natural language processing pipeline for Indian languages and built a chat-bot over Whatsapp which is currently connecting companies like Dunzo, Dominos & Ecom Express with potential front-line workers and fulfilling the hiring requirements of this industry in a scalable and autonomous fashion. 1. Introduction to the High volume Recruitment problem 2. Breakdown of the problem in terms of technical challenges 3. Natural Language Processing Pipeline 4. Building a data collection pipeline 5.

Note: I might not have a working example to show this, given it was my work done in my previous organisation The entire algorithm basically consisted of 3 major steps: Address structuring Identification of addresses Clustering The addresss structuring is a huge problem given addresses of India which are highly unorganised. What adds to a Data Scientist’s pain is the address field being a free text for customers, you can see all kinds of radomness there! Hence, cleaning of the address data is utterly important and no NLP libraries built for english languages can be of major help here, since addresses have their own stop words. Training of this address data is another important step to be able to build a model with accuracy. Once the data is trained well, choosing the right algorithm that can help identify each address is another major challenge. Once that’s achieved with enough confidence, all you need to do is use a clustering method to cluster your addresses.

A lot of this conference is devoted to the matter of “craft” - of becoming a better designer, a better developer and so on. However, how do you do your best work when part of a larger team? Throwing more people at the problem is not always the solution; and design management has historically been worse than other types of management. Most business leaders aren’t designers, and many design leaders have risen due to their proficiency in the practice of their craft - not because of their managerial, emotional or operational skills. This talk is an attempt to provide an answer to that question. What structures do you need? What new processes does one put in? How do you ensure that designers (designers are often hyper-sensitive to the imposition of structure and restraint) do not chafe against these?

Whether it is the safeguard against letting silly bugs slide in production code or enforcing certain styles and practices for everyone involved in contributing to the code base, we can all agree that writing tests is an important part of the development lifecycle. But there is something else also we can all agree on. WRITING TESTS IS A PAIN IN THE BOTTOM. This talk was born out of the sheer frustration of: - Writing hundreds and thousands of tests and then modifying them all because of a slight change in the code base. - Spending more time writing tests than the actual code. - Spending hours going through fixtures to find out where the tests are breaking. - Mocking and stubbing and faking and what not just to create an ideal test scenario. - Re-running pipelines and hoping the flaky tests don’t pop up again. - Struggling with the assertion failures, stack traces and error messages to figure out what went wrong and where. And you get the idea. We went back and forth with a lot of different test strategies and a few things finally clicked and made sense. This is an attempt to share all those learnings with developers who have faced the issues mentioned above during writing or fixing tests, in the hope that these can be used as standards moving forward to save you and your team from hours of frustration.

The realtime bits of the GraphQL spec is one such horizons-widening abstraction when we use it as a tool to think about architecting an asynchronous, event-driven backend. Architecting the frontend of applications to consume a fundamentally async backend is still a challenge. GraphQL subscriptions and live-queries offer an opportunity to design a “reactive” contract between the backend and the frontend. In this model, an app makes a GraphQL mutation and then runs a GraphQL subscription to get updates as they happen. The business logic in serverless functions gets triggered automatically after the mutation and app gets success/error updates as and when they happen. With serverless functions, we get an auto-scalable, resilient backend which is perfect for processing asynchronous actions and stateless workloads. Such tasks include sending emails/push notifications, ETL, long running business logic etc. With no servers to provision and zero ops-tasks, it is very easy for a front-end developer to write and deploy these complex logic as functions in NodeJS etc. To draw on the Redux analogy, GraphQL mutations are actions, datastore is the “state”, asynchronous business logic are the “reducers”, and GraphQL subscriptions/live-queries become the state update glue. In this talk, I will talk about how we can use GraphQL and event-driven serverless functions to reason about the data-flow in an application.

They all need authentication. But obviously, you’d maintain a common authentication and user database. Also, in this age, you cannot make a login system without Login with [Facebook|Google|Twitter|...] For the second thing, you need to consume Oauth2.0 (the industry standard now), for the first thing, you need to make your own Oauth server. And you want all of this to happen securely (so yeah, little to no frontend JS) This talk is nothing but my journey of building oneauth Even before we had a tech team, I knew we’d be building at least 2 very disconnected products, but having a common authentication mechanism. My search for a reference took me to HasGeek’s own - Lastser I eventually wrote my own in NodeJS, which uses a lot of open source tools from Auth0 (including the famous Passport.js) Also we had a lot of users using an older website with user accounts made there. Our new website seamlessly migrates them when they login for the first time on new website. What we will cover is - - Usual local authentication (email + username + password) - Best practices (no frontend JS, bcrypt passwords, project strucuture) - Consuming Oauth from Facebook/Twitter/Github or others - Connecting existing account to social logins - Fallback strategies (migrating users silently from old website without showing them) - Building your own Oauth2.0 server - Consuming your own Oauth in your clients (Web and/or Mobile) - Deduplicating users without breaking loose hell - Maintaining state across login logic (returnTo, redirectTo) Some important theory covered will be - - Authentication vs Authorization (without the Aadhaar debate ;P ) - Authentication via Authorization (OpenID connect) - OpenID vs Oauth - Oauth1.0 vs Oauth2.0 - Implicit vs Explicit Authorization (serverless vs w/server consumers) - Cookies vs Tokens - Tokens (Bearer vs JWT: having server-side deauthorization capability) - Token Refreshing logic Our story is a typical startup turning half-baked PoC’s and MVP’s into production ready websites.

This was not the first time SC upheld right to privacy as it has been doing this in a number of decisions since Maneka Gandhi vs UoI (1978). The SC has repeatedly upheld in last four decades that individuals have autonomy over personal choices and can control over dissemination of their personal information. However, the right to privacy is not absolute and is subject to own set of restrictions. In R. Rajagopal (1994), SC laid out the contours of the right to privacy while dealing with the biography of a convicted criminal and held that right to privacy ceases to exist in matters of public records including court records. It is because the right to privacy gives way to people right to know that is part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech (Article 19(1)(a)). Now what this means is that once a personal dispute or a commercial dispute reaches the courts it becomes matter of public record. In this talk, I will highlight the challenges of public exposure of such public data-sets and how sensitive people are with respect to the so called public records. Since many court judgments are related to living people, the public availability impacts them in terms of their marriage, business and job prospects and sometimes just reputation in the society. Some of these impacts may be justified or not but a mere publisher cannot sit in the judgment of these issues. Court approach to these issues have mostly been ad hoc and they ordered case removal or name anonymization in some cases where as refused to entertain other pleas. As public availability of such data increases, we will see more of the right to know conflict with the right to privacy. I will also outline legal and regulatory changes that can be taken up for balancing such conflict.

XStream is also capable of running Big Data batch jobs as streaming computation on a static data.It allows to switch from batch processing jobs to stream processing jobs and viceversa. XStream provides you with ready to use I/O connectors,interface to use static dataset for joins and lookups and connectors to perform realtime fast lookup on Redis,HBase and BigTable. Complex and important part of handling job failures gracefully,bad data handling,getting realtime descriptiive and prescriptive metrics dashboard for your running jobs,defining and scheduling workflows on your batch and streaming jobs, are another very important aspect it gracefully handles out of the box for all your pipelines. XStream also focuses on defining all important data featurization operators needed to create Machine Learning models.It allows to embed online Machine Learning models into XStream pieplines and also create Machine Learning models using it Drag and Drop constructs. UseCase: Realtime Market Propensity Modeling An existing Fortune 500 Online Retailor had their batch Market Propensity models which took around 24 hours to generate updated models to be used in their Machine Learning Pipelines.Due to huge infrastructure cost they created their Models on sample data. Business usecases needed upgrade in existing model to be updated in realtime.They had issues in maintaining realtime customer segment profiles and customer product profiles. XStream helped not only change the existing Market Propensity pipeline from Batch to Realtime but its effective feature generation operators helped reduce the time and infrastructure cost. Complete input data was used to generate Market Propensity models , Realtime Customer Segment Profiles and Customer Product Profiles. The customer could use the same pipeline for batch or streaming inputs,on a click of a button, thereby avoiding the re-engineering required to developed two workflows. We will explain the existing model logic , how it was mapped in XStream by a ETL Developer who could never imagine creating similar workflows like skilled Big Data Developers and run it without much hassle.One doesn’t need to focus on tuning the jobs as the important aspects of connection tuning, getting metrics on input rate,memory usage,shuffle and alert on ill configured job parameters,bypassing and storing bad data records in separate sink are handled by XStream.

We run many complex ETL workflows to process this data and provide reports, insights and recommendations to customers, analysts and data scientists. We use open source distribution of Apache Airflow to orchestrate our ETLs and process more than 1 terabyte of data daily. These ETLs differ in terms of frequencies, types of data, transformation logic and their SLA’s. Due to the volume of data and differences amongst ETLs, it becomes difficult to monitor the quality of data. Errors are introduced at all stages - extraction, transformation or load and usually happen due to infrastructural or logical issues. In order to catch these errors, we came up with the idea of using assert queries, just like we have assert statements in a unit test framework. These queries would run after an extraction/transformation/load step has finished and run some predefined diagnostic queries on the data to match the output against some expected value. In this talk, I will Discuss the complexities involved in detecting discrepancies in the output of any data transformation process and protecting any downstream process in case of any issue. Introduce the approach we have adopted for running these assert queries based on the Check operator in Apache Airflow to quantify data quality and alert on it. Discuss the enhancements we have made in the Qubole’s fork of Apache Airflow’s check operator in order to use it at a bigger scale and with more variety of data. We plan to contribute these enhancements back to Apache Airflow soon. Talk about the lessons learnt and best practices in maintaining data sanity for data in motion. We have integrated most of our ETLs with these data quality verification techniques, and the results look promising. We have been able to make this work across ETLs having nothing in common but the fact that they run on Apache Airflow.

Many of them end up making a purchase in the same session and most, well, do not. Display retargeting channels, with ads over open web and your favourite social media sites, are then used to reach out to the potential customers with relevant content. The ad serving comes at a cost and optimizing these costs becomes especially important given the huge scale. Predicting a user’s purchase (or click) propensity and bidding appropriately is crucial for reaching out to the right user with the right content and at the right time. We discuss how we, at WalmartLabs, build the user propensity prediction models to efficiently bid for ad impressions. We start from ground zero - understanding data nuances and formulating the problem. We delve into the finer aspects of offline data crunching and building models and pipelines on top of petabytes of user data. We further elaborate the critical stage of deploying models into the real world, where the model scores are just not enough! We also discuss the affect of multiple user touchpoints on these models and how ‘robust’ algorithms come to the rescue.

From a single run of the application, Sparklens provides insights about scalability limits of given spark application. In this talk we will cover the what Sparklens does and theory behind Sparklens. We will talk about how structure of spark application puts important constraints on its scalability. How can we find these structural constraints and how to use these constraints as a guide in solving performance and scalability problems of spark applications. This talk will help audience in answering the following questions about their spark applications: 1) Will their application run faster with more executors? 2) How will cluster utilization change as number of executors change? 3) What is the absolute minimum time this application will take even if we give it infinite executors? 4) What is the expected wall clock time for the application when we fix the most important structural limits of these application?

It is not as simple as deploying on a cloud and expecting it to scale alongwith the cloud’s elasticity. Many systems and solutions that claim elasticity of scale often indirectly limit their claims to stateless services. Building and scaling stateless systems has far fewer challenges over stateful systems. That said, stateless services are limited by data centre infrastructure and begs attention at large footprints - at tens of millions of requests per second. It is therefore seemingly easier to scale stateless services and adds credence to claims of almost limitless elastic scale. Serverless architecture offers the convenience of zero server deployments while preserving elasticity of scaling. In reality, there is little truth in a truly stateless service, in fact it is a case of state being pushed to another service/system. The challenges therefore shift to scaling stateful services - something harder to achieve. In this talk I will start with an overview of typical application workloads - online vs offline, interactive vs batch, sync vs async etc. and commonly used patterns and libraries to build these systems. We will also evaluate each of these examples to identify critical stateful services/systems and the challenges in scaling them. We will then take the Flipkart Flux open source project as an example to understand the design of a highly scalable stateful system that offers serverless computing for deployed applications, similar to AWS Lambda.

In media and public discussion algorithms tend to receive the most attention, and for young data scientists they are often what seem most exciting. This talk will focus on the two underrated other components: workflow and data.

This talk estimates the impact on bike-share ridership of two facets of system performance: accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). My analysis is based on a structural modelling pricinples from economics to allow causal inference and accurately model and estimate user behavior while using only aggregated station use data for estimation. The proposed model is able to incorporate the real time changes in bike-availability information, and include hyperlocal data on potential demand sources for accurate predictions. This model turns out to be computationally expensive; we transform our estimation from the time domain to the “local-stockout- state” domain to address this. The model has about 50% better prediction performance than common methods. I illustrate the use of these estimates in identifying neighborhoods and times to target for improvements, and in comparing alternate operational improvements and station networks. Ashish Kabra is a tenure-track faculty member in the Department of Operations and Information Techonology at the University of Maryland, College Park.

It’s promise of providing a unique multi-modal biometric backed Identity to everyone in India has hinged on the quality of biometric templates obtained during enrollment and also the veracity and trustworthiness of the identity documents. The scale needed for the project can only be achieved through enrollment centers that are spread out and available in every village. The UIDAI enlisted Common Service Centers (CSC) and 60,000 Private agents for both enrollment and updates. Frauds are inevitable in such a scaled-up system and hence much care was taken to standardize the enrollment process through software, which was deployed on the enrollment centers. Another set of defences were built in the back end through data analytics to detect fraud. Every confirmed fraud resulted in adding more security features in the enrollment software. However the UP Aadhaar hack case, provided the first glimpse into how the fraudsters managed to disable the security features and also defeat the back end data analytics. The offline nature of data acquisition provided a window large enough to compromise the data quality of the biometric templates and the identity documents without getting detected for at least an year. Further the streamlining of the process of data acquisition, made it very hard to stop the deployment and further usage of the compromised software even today, thus illustrating the problem of data acquisition at scale with good quality.

They evolve iteratively with business and need to react quickly to the changing business landscape to minimize time to market. Analytical systems, on the other hand, require data models to maximize query throughput over broad, deep and large data volumes. The need for a platform which transforms from the transactional data model to an analytical data model is well established in the industry. This is currently achieved through two different paradigms. Stream processing at lower latencies and batch processing at higher latencies. We have solved the same problem through a third paradigm of incremental processing for intermediate latencies (5 minutes to 1 hour). We considered and dropped implementations of the streaming paradigm either because of a lack of completeness guarantees or the absence of complex join capabilities across a large number of entities. Our incremental processing platform transforms transactional data models to analytical data models. It provides expressability for complex joins across multiple entities (live with 30) through a Transformation Definition Language (TDL). These complex joins are evaluated incrementally as transactional data changes to periodically update the analytical data model. For near real time use cases, this is done every 5-10 minutes. Changes to transactional data models are handled through version support in the TDL. These changes are absorbed with a pause and resume of the transformations. The Flipkart Fulfillment Services Group serves over a million shipments in a day at its peak. Customer delight through a reliable and fast delivery of orders is our primary goal. To succeed in this endeavour, our ground operations depends on live and accurate visibility into the journey of all shipments pan India. Overall data volumes range in 10s of TBs with a change frequency of over 25k QPS at peak. All our transactional systems combined generate mutations with volumes close to 200 GB every second. Our incremental platform is built to handle this scale. With this platform, we have achieved analytics at low latencies with high completeness without compromising on business agility.

A real-time and accurate object detection technique can help in several critical systems and applications such as self-driving cars (detecting multiple instances of vehicles, humans, etc.), surveillance for public safety, social media intelligence etc. In this talk, we will first understand the problem and go through the complexity levels of different object detection datasets. We will then look at a state-of-the-art of object detection technique : single shot multi-box detection. We will then understand its drawbacks. We will extend this technique using unsupervised learning and feature map confluence to remove the drawbacks. This extension especially helps in those problems and applications where large amount of labeled data is not available. We will then compare performance of these techniques on various datasets. Taking into account sparsity of datasets in various domains, we will then take a deep experimental dive into when and why a particualr object detection technique works and does not work. We will go through a case study to understand different nuiances of different object detection techniques. Key takeways: Challenges in doing object detection beyond open source datasets An end-to-end solution with an open design A detailed case study and related experiences of applying and comparing different object detection techniques in practice Note : this work is accepted as a full research publication.

Initially, we used redux to manage the state of react application. As the app grew in size, we were writing lots of custom logic for network use cases like data fetching, real time updates and error handling. We implemented abstractions to reduce verbosity of network logic. But, onboarding new developers and adding new features was hard because of the home-grown abstractions. We found GraphQL and Apollo in our exploration to simplify the network logic. GraphQL and Apollo helped us a lot in simplifying network logic on both back-end and front-end code.

This is relatively easy to do when you begin a new project, but what happens when you take over an existing codebase with little to no tests? Have you encountered questions like: Most of this is legacy code hence not writing tests and gradually the test coverage decreases? This is not my code, why should I write tests or maintain tests for it? Where and how do you start writing tests? This task can be very intimidating and frustrating. Ideal approach: Team halts on going development and covers whole legacy codebase. And then the Real Life happens: Due to the timelines and priorities this doesn’t seem feasible and the amount of refactoring required to cover legacy code is something a new team member would not be interested in doing. How do we find the middle practical ground Well, yes we had the same problem, and everytime we merged new code, we decreased the overall coverage. That’s where we came up with a simple approach which we named “Shield” which shields the newly added code not going into the system without the coverage. In this talk, we will see how shield solves it and the “Legacy code …” songs are stopped. Will also demonstrate how shield works, how can you also create shield for your own context.

Are there any similar patterns we can use to make production database changes less risky? Indeed, there are. The Expand/Contract pattern is a blueprint for making the database migration. It makes the remodelling both reversible and safe. By expanding the application to accommodate both the old and the new schemas in parallel, we can give ourselves time to: Migrate any downstream dependencies on the old database schema Gain confidence that the migration is safe We contract the application to the new version, once we’ve satisfied that the old schema is no longer needed. The pattern helps to make significant, but necessary refactorings to your data model in a continuous delivery way. Most importantly, without threatening the robustness of your production applications. While working with our product GoodKarma, I’ve successfully applied this pattern to make major changes to the core of the application, all while serving customers in production. I’ve learned some important lessons about how to best implement the Expand/Contract pattern. In this session, I’ll share my experiences on how to avoid pitfalls and succeed at these kinds of major data remodelling with hardly any downtime. Leena is a CTO/Programmer @ Good Karma, Bangalore.

The commercial security product landscape remains too fragmented, creating intelligence siloes within an organisation which the attackers wade through with ease and elegance. The internet has always been driven by standards with commercial applications being an afterthought, whereas in cybersecurity it has been the opposite. Such is the state of affairs in this industry that the contemporary security architecture itself has been weaponized and become completely divergent from the threat. No reason, even after 25 years, we are still running an anti-virus. This is an existential reckoning not only for organisations but for nation states as well; and we are not even touching upon the geopolitics of the situation. There’s no corporate or government in cyber – they are joined to the hip. The older models, which heavily focused on detection, have given way to new paradigms of response and mitigation with an emphasis on sharing and collaboration. Rounding off situational awareness from human to machine speed is also on the horizon. This talk will discuss some aspects of that. The evolution of machine-to-machine orchestration standards like Open Command-&-Control (OpenC2) and Structured Threat Information Exchange (STIX) is a case in point. The rise of Information Sharing & Analysis Centres (ISACs) in the United States also heralds a new approach towards cyber defence. So is the increasing adoption of open source security automation stacks like Apache Metron and Apache Spot which challenges the hegemony of horrible monstrosities called the Security Incident & Event Management (SIEMs). We would visit the case studies and practical applications of these emerging frameworks, which hint at a broader churn within the domain.

He was laterally inducted into the Government from the private sector at a very short notice after the 26/11 attacks. It was a multi-disciplinary tenure, ranging from geopolitical doctrine formulation, eventually approved by the Prime Minister, to the very brass tacks of cyber operations. Later, he spent some time at Aadhaar, India’s flagship social security project as the national cybersecurity manager. Pukhraj also had very brief stints in the private sector, working with Symantec’s DeepSight Threat Intelligence Team – industry’s first threat intelligence platform – and other innovative American, Canadian and Israeli firms.

Here we will know the difference between the DNS and DNS64 system. Is DNSSec possible for DNS64 or not. What are the steps we have to be careful of at the deployment time and how we can mitigate the security aspects of DNS64 system. Yes security is a myth. But can we just sit back and do nothing ? No thats not possible and that should not be. Technologies are changing day by day. So do we have to change our thoughts.

No its not Ethan Hunt of Mission Impossible. Its threat hunting I am going to talk and yah Its real time manual, I repeat manual activities of human being who are responsible to take care of your infrastructure. No, they dont have to be the expert of everything or they dont have to have several years of experience. But yes, they do need to have experience on how these infrastructure works. Here, we will discuss how we will find out the Evil; the vulnerabilities; of your infrastructure. How it can be done. There are some talks that it can be done by automating things, like creating tools that fits your need or Talking with companies who have their best products which can work great. I will say NO. Threat hunting must need human interaction, who knows what services, OSs, applications are running, what sort of network infrastructure do you have. How they relate to each other. The person need to have analytical abilities who can think beyond, who can find out the missed things of the infrastructure monitoring system. Threat hunting process can be different based on the infrastructure and obviously the Needs. Proper planing, preparation, expertise, experience and execution is very important. You just cant buy some tools and put some highly paid expert at your SOC and sit back and say you are doing great by hunting down the vulnerabilities. You need to follow some standards and Yes obviously you have to be Innovative. Doing the same steps and same procedure again and again wont give you the result. We will learn here, what to hunt for and how often we have to do it. What tools we can use for our need not for our want. How the person have to be for this sort of responsibilities. And so on. Threat hunting is not an easy task but not that complex too. To secure the most valuable things of earth, the Information, we have to be proactive not reactive. And this should be our goal to Hunt down the Evil. I am an Open-source software enthusiast, system solution architect and Linux system expert with over 10 years of extensive experience; right now working on Linux OS developments from the scratch. I am also an Information Security professional with over 8 years of diverse Information Security experience; from the evolving enterprise needs of large and complex organizations to the development of large public web properties, and protecting their applications, data and infrastructure from attack.

They can be written using a simple UX DSL leveraging continuation passing style (CSP) semantics. Despite this being the most important problem to simplify, we find that the current frameworks complicate the building and maintenance of transactional apps, requiring heavy investment in engineering effort and the development process is not a pleasant creative experience. At Juspay, we saw no reason for this to be the case, and set out to create a framework to dramatically lower the barriers of entry for quickly building out solutions to typical real world applications. Being strong believers in the functional programming paradigm, we abstracted out all the parts of an app as extremely composable lego blocks / pure functions. As a JavaScript house, we explored a number of options and chose PureScript as our core language. Purescript has the conciseness of Haskell paired with the ubiquity of the JavaScript interpreter. The UI components and business flows are simple pure functions that are reusable across apps. The frontend and backend are unified, represented as a continuation of flow between the client and server. In the last several months, we have made major strides towards allowing everyone in our company to be able to examine and write the code of the apps we are building – from fresher to product manager to designer. We have trained around 100 interns on Haskell and PureScript to work on our platform in production. We have been able to deploy this framework into production in serious payment and banking systems.

As Bitcoin has dispersed into dozens or hundreds of viable cryptocurrencies, startups and venture capitalists are beginning to consider other alternative use cases of blockchains as a means of decentralized consensus. Meanwhile, major sectors of the financial industry, transportation infrastructure, and social media are increasingly dominated by machine learning algorithms, and AI is gradually augmenting or automating various human faculties. The influence of both of these technologies is further expanded by more of our everyday appliances getting connected to the internet and accumulating data. A primordial soup of ingredients for widespread decentralized AI is forming, and many are beginning to speculate about its potential; is it a libertarian panacea to an unjust society, or a totalitarian nightmare with no off-switch? Gene Kogan is an artist and a programmer who is interested in generative systems, artificial intelligence, and software for creativity and self-expression. He is a collaborator within numerous open-source software projects, and leads workshops and talks on topics at the intersection of code and art. Gene initiated and contributes to ml4a, a free book about machine learning for artists, activists, and citizen scientists.

As our data size grew so were the operational difficulties surronding them. When we were a team with small number of developers and a single ops person, using a centralised configuration management system made a lot of sense. Any changes would go through him resulting in a very less overhead. As we scaled our team that single person became a bottleneck for different teams. He wasn’t able to cope up with new things that individual teams wanted to try for their respective set of challenges. This lead to individual teams stepping up to manage their own infrastructure parts on AWS. That’s when we realised we needed a more de-centralised, respective team owned configuration management across the organization. While most teams welcomed the change, some teams with no prior operational experience found this transition very hard. After a lot of attempts we started using a self-serviced, resource based scheduling for individual services for these teams. Self managed infrastructure is a dream to any operational team in an organization, but it does come with it’s fair share of challenges. In this talk, I’ll cover our problems, mistakes and learnings over the years on scaling the operations to everyone at Indix and how some our technology choices were influenced by them.

Our scale of data is in TBs which we deliver to our customers through APIs and Bulk Feeds. We use resources on AWS cloud extensively which comes at a significant cost. As our infrastructure scaled, we realised cost optimisation on AWS cloud as an important operational challege. We adopted most of the standard best practices for controlling costs which reduced our cloud costs to a large extent. However, one of our biggest challenge was to keep track of costs which were incurred on account of unexpected or unknown events like rapid upscaling/downscaling of Autoscaling Groups, untracked Hadoop jobs with a potential to incur huge data transfer costs, ondemand EC2 instances which are not in use and ofcourse human erros. This is where we built “Plutus”, a near real time cost monitoring tool, where we could programatically monitor cost on each and every AWS resource and get alerted when a set threshold cost is crossed for a resource on daily/weekly basis. Post deploying this, we are now able to keep track of the cost incurred by all our systems which definitely gives us a tight control over our monthly AWS expenses. In this talk, I’ll talk about our learnings on cost optimisation, the strategies on AWS we follow at Indix, architecture and implentation of Plutus, it’s direct impact on AWS costs and it’s future scope of being a full fledged open source project.

The push to digital payments has been particularly strong after the demonetization policy, the development and implementation of Aadhaar and India Stack. Services offered by Fintech firms can range from offering a loan or credit to a digital wallet and digital banking and payment services. Presently, there is a regulatory gap for many of the fintech services and business models. The Reserve Bank of India has published consultation papers on Peer-to-Peer lending platforms as well as Account Aggregators, but comprehensive regulations, especially those surrounding minimum security practices, have yet to emerge – presenting a critical policy and research window. Furthermore, under Section 43A of the IT Act and its associated Rules, ‘body corporates’ are required to implement reasonably security procedures compliant with ISO27001 or a sectoral standard approved by the Central Government. However, currently such a sectoral standard is absent for the FinTech and Digital Payments space. The growing prevalence of these fintech technologies and the criticality of security of the same to engender citizen trust, protect rights, and comprehensive national security posture demands debate and discussion. On November 17th, HasGeek in collaboration with the Centre for Internet and Society will be holding an Open House from 6pm - 8pm to discuss security practices in the fintech industry.

The second layer is a conceptual monopoly of four fundamentals: money, ledger, law & labor; and the third layer is an institutional monopoly of four elements; banking, taxation, corporation and political governance. The blockchain is a peer to peer governance logic that disrupts all these three layers and their constituents in a unique way. If our entrepreneurs and thinkers focus on composing bits of this shift, they can create a completely alternative reality in 1000 ways. The blockchain space gives P2P actors same power and autonomy that governments and corporations used to have. So, we are venturing into a world of open partnerships and alliances.

But we soon realised that, components(reusable components) are getting messier, since there are so many components just because everything is component in React. Components started growing like crazy. Problem - Since we have our mobile website and desktop website separate (though we serve both with housing.com), we had to write same react components in desktop as well as mobile, may be with just styling / css changes, but the logical flow & business use case of a software feature used to remain same. Solution - Isolating bunch of components as a black box. We started creating npm modules, and including them in a code as a feature. So our isolated react component is not just a dump component, but it takes care of executing entire feature. Going further and decoupling things - it was easy for us to figure it out, what should be isolated component, what should not be. I will be showing when to make Isolated component and when not to.

Big organizations run such micro services in 100’s and are often looked up to by engineers in startups/smaller companies, too eager to join that league. However the hard reality is that only a few startups will survive to scale and need micro services. Busting the hype, the experts are suggesting smaller companies to adopt writing modular code instead of microservices code. How do you write modular code in NodeJs and why are they better than microservices? Modules are blocks of functionality that are bigger than micro services, a few files ideally. A few modules can be piped/joined together to make an app. They share a lot of similarities to micro services and hence to title — modular services in a monolith. A well written modular code can be broken up into microservices (when being deployed) and also tested upon as a single app (when running on a laptop).

We wanted to allow newcomer developers, designers and project managers to be able to jump in and start creating solutions to their problems, without jumping through the hoops created by the language and tools. As a JavaScript house, we explored a number of options and chose PureScript as our core language. It paired the conciseness of Haskell with the ubiquity of the JavaScript interpreter, allowing us to make a staged transition. We modeled the UI components and business flows as simple, pure functions that are reusable across apps. The frontend and backend were naturally unified, and could be represented as a continuation of flow between the client and server. In the last several months, we have made major strides towards allowing everyone in our company to be able to examine and write code for the apps we are building.

Whether you’re writing a back-end, front-end or a mobile app — and whether you’re using jQuery, React, Angular, Vue or your favourite framework-du-jour — TypeScript can significantly improve your development experience with its incredible tooling and refactoring support that can help you catch bugs as you type and bring sanity to managing large codebases. In this session, I’ll take you through the amazing world of TypeScript’s language features and its rich out-of-the-box IDE affordances such as cross-referencing and auto-completion, experiences that developers working with traditional statically-typed languages take for granted. I’ll also show you how all the latest ES2015/16/17 features are natively available in TypeScript with a greatly simplified configuration compared to Babel’s and how you can take advantage of static typing to auto-generate a nice documentation for your project.

It has become very difficult for a new developer or even an existing developer to decide which Framework or Tool to choose for his next project. Angular, React, Ember, Vue are few of the myriad of options available, and some time evaluating few of these for the best fit is unending. All the browsers have come to a stage where they are almost implementing most of the new Web Standards and now developers do not need to invest much time in Browser Compatibility. Although all the front end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue & Ember have different core architectures but they are converging on a common principle design pattern i.e. Component Driven architecture. Web Components with the customElements v1 API released on most popular browsers are the solution to take standardisation of the web to the next level. Web Components can help us build standard re-usable custom html elements with bundled CSS, HTML & JS (for behaviours). It will enable all developers to build performant, maintainable web apps unlocking the full potential of the browser. Potential Benefits of Web Components Perfectly reusable components across all browsers & even with multiple frameworks like React, Ember, Vue Reduction of efforts in maintenance and upgradation with new features Single File with bundled HTML & CSS Drive the principle of Composition for component driven approach in building web apps * Standardisation of the Web Web Components have already been taken into production use by several big companies such as Google, GitHub, Comcast, Salesforce and General Electric. Some of the more high profile sites using Web Components are Youtube Gaming, Google Patents, Google Music and GitHub. We all web developers have a contribution towards the community to reduce the pain of new people learning development and making an endeavour to work towards standardisation. In this way we can spend more time in building great and engaging User Experiences rather than learning all of these different platforms and frameworks.

When we looked at the known existing solutions like CodePush etc, we found three major issues that were not solved but were critical for us: The updates were not really instant as a cached bundle gets loaded while it silently gets updated in the background. These updates were enormous in size (around 700kB) as the entire bundle gets downloaded at the client-end everytime an update is shipped. For our average 2G users who visit the app once a month, it would take more than 30s for the React Native bundle to get downloaded and the page to be loaded everytime the App is launched. We have multiple teams maintaining their own React Native bundles. When these teams themselves share a lot of common components besides the React Native Framework Code, lots of redundant download is caused. We built our own system which efficiently solved all of these issues and is being used by multiple Apps inside Flipkart. This talk will give a detailed description of the solution and teach the audience to build their own optimized solution to deliver instant OTA updates for React Native.

Tackling this problem requires a mix of NLP (to deal with text data), computer vision (to deal with product images), ontology management and more (to ingest a host of other signals on offer). I’ve been working on this problem in various capacities for a few years now at Semantics3. During this period, I’ve made a fair number of mistakes which in turn have taught me useful lessons about applying deep/machine learning in an industry setting. During this talk, I’d like to walk you through 5 specific scenarios in which I attempted to achieve a specific goal in the context of product matching, but ran into an unexpected problem that threw a spanner in the works. I’ll then talk about the root cause that sprouted the problem in the first place and the lesson I learned having made this discovery. Where relevant, I’ll bring in examples from outside the retail domain to broaden the perspective offered. The goal of the talk isn’t to provide a guidebook for solving the product matching problem - the goal is to give you insight into the ups and downs of working through a specific data-science problem, and in the process, delivering packaged lessons that you could potentially draw on in your own field of work.

Television (specifically Linear TV) will continue to be the most efficient way to get high quality content to millions of homes. Even though all the devices around us have gotten smarter - people still watch TV by memorizing channel numbers and move between painful guides. At the root of this problem is the lack of enough “smart” data about what’s happening on TV. Do you know? What channels are playing English Action Movies that are not in an Ad Break? Do you know which Ad is playing on (say) Star Plus? Do you know which celebrities are on screen - right now - across 400 channels? Do you know which shows are talking about Trump, right now? Deeper data about Linear TV not only enables much better experiences for the viewer, but the entire industry.

The obvious failures of static graph implementation for certain use cases is increasing industry wide adoption of PyTorch. Dynamic Computation Graph being the backbone of PyTorch, comes with some perks. - Super intuitive - Shallow learning curve - Amazing community and discussion forum - Easy debugging It puts you explicitly in control of your compute, there’s no compiler trying to be clever and “help you” or speed your code up, but in reality mostly leading to a massive amount of debugging headaches. PyTorch should be the go-to framework for the problem with “dynamicity” in the core, especially for RNNs and highly dynamic Reinforcement Learning algorithms. My talk would be to convince the audience about the advantages of PyTorch. For what problems pytorch would be the best solution. I will have benchmarks with popular DL frameworks that review speed, performance, memory, and easiness. I’ll try to build on top of a comparison foundation with TF and NumPy so that the audience could correlate with their day to day research/development projects.

Deep Learning has been shown to achieve spectacular results in almost all domains. But as expected, there is always a price to pay for everything, especially for better things. And here the price is the interpretability and simplicity. Moreover, the amount of resources required by deep learning is huge, but that is not much of a concern in today’s era. With such huge promises, deep learning has become the panacea. Is it really true? How deep is Deep Learning? We explore such questions and will discuss some interesting findings and insights when deep learning is applied in education domain (Knowledge Tracing, to be precise). Deep Learning was introduced in education domain very recently to trace the learner’s knowledge, which is referred to as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Knowledge Tracing models the process of knowledge acquisition by tracking learner’s progress/knowledge from interaction to interaction and generates a profile of learner’s strengths and weaknesses. DKT model uses a large hidden layer of LSTM units to model the dynamic and temporal nature of learner’s progression. funtoot is a personalised digital tutor which has more than 1 lakh active students across India. We apply Deep Knowledge Tracing on a dataset generated by 6th Grade students on funtoot which has more than 5 million datapoints (In education domain, the dataset of this size is a rare find). We compare it with the standard classic knowledge tracing models called Bayesian Knowledge (BKT) and Performance Factor Analysis (PFA). DKT outperforms BKT with a very good margin but DKT and PFA perform equally well. We analyse and understand the gain which DKT acheives over BKT and identify probable reasons (limitations) as to why BKT lags behind. Classic BKT, when tweaked and enhanced to overcome those limitations performs as good as DKT. Though, DKT being comparable to classic simple algorithms an advantage of ability to discover the relationships and interdepencies (pre-requisites) among skills. Owing to a big hidden layer of LSTM units, DKT has parameters of the order of few hundred thousands, while the classical models like PFA and BKT have approximately few hundreds of them. Comparing just in the amount of parameters and the complexity of the models, DKT does not have an edge over much simpler models. A way to interpret this result is to appreciate the depth of the underlying domain of the problem. It seems the domain of knowledge tracing is shallow and the powerful deep learning models are unneccessary. We will discuss more about this in the talk. This talk is based on our work published as “Few hundred parameters outperform few hundred thousand?” in Educational Data Mining Conference, 2017 (EDM2017).

This quasi-imperceptible noise can fool the state-of-the-art deep models (eg: object recognition CNNs) to infer wrong predictions. This noise is referred to as adversarial perturbation. It is shown that perturbation computed for one network is able to fool a new network trained with different architecture or subset of training data. Transferability of these adversarial perturbations across multiple networks is a serious issue for deploying the models. In my talk, I would introduce the concept of adversarial images/attacks and discuss recent developments in this area.

The data usually needs to be cleaned and processed and that might take a while, but it is generally close to where it needs to be. It can be incredibly exciting and engaging to work at one level back, where data is far from where it needs to be. At this level real work has to be done to transform data into a form ready to be turned into value. In this talk I will walk through this process with the example of turning raw transactional SMS text into structured personal finance features. The work involves several steps of interest that I will present in the talk. It begins with creatively reducing and representing financial life (or any domain) with concise and clearly defined features. This is a step often overlooked in the rush to fit models and if not done well is most likely to ensure the work fails. Next is taking a difficult composite problem and breaking it into pieces. As Max Tegmark put it: “If you have a tough question that you can’t answer, first tackle a simpler question that you can’t answer.” I’ll show how machine-learning models can be combined in sequence to progressively build up structure and refine raw text into meaningful pieces of information. While illustrating each step in the work with concrete examples (with code usually written in Python), I will focus on the generalizable process of designing and building machine learning pipelines and transforming raw data into features (using programming language/framework of choice).

Frequently it is also the single most constrained resource in the application stack. While most database vendors will want you to believe their solution is the panacea for database scalability problems, it only leaves a developer confused among the plethora of SQL and NoSQL databases. This talk will guide you through key information, trends, innovations and challenges in choosing your next database/store. A well informed choice looks at a number of factors such as : Schema, Query language, Data Distribution, Tools for operations, Ability to efficiently leverage available resources - CPU, Memory, Disk(SSD), Moving data to Analtics and/or across data centres, Query engine, Transaction/Durability and Consistency guarantees, ability to leverage Non-Volatile memory(NVM) etc. In this talk I will cover many of these factors that influence datastore selection for different applications, catering to varied types of workloads - and will provide examples from my work in building Aadhaar database, the Flipkart catalog systems and more recently in HealthFace where we are building data driven decision systems like chatbots, automated symptom analysis and personal health records.

A lot of GPU resources and training data are required for the deep-learning model to perform image-matching. While GPU is something that most companies can afford, training data is hard to obtain. At DataWeave, we crawl millions of products listed across e-commerce websites, and match them to deliver competitive insights to our clients. In the fashion vertical, however, text matching alone is insufficient to accurately match products, as product descriptions are usually not detailed enough. We asked ourselves, is there any way of complementing information from product descriptions and titles to improve the accuracy of image-matching? Solr is a popular text search engine known for its NLP capabilities.

We will then present a brief overview of a database platform that has proven to be well suited for handling such use cases. In payment systems, detecting fraud as it happens is critical to maintaining the integrity of the business. This could mean that for each payment transaction, several components in the payment chain have to be both monitored in real time and analysed for anomalies based on recent historical data to enable a decision to be made in 200-500 milliseconds. In trading systems, there is a need to constantly calculate risk on a database of changing customer positions (due to both trades and fluctuations in stock values). These calculations are critical in enabling a better user experience by allowing faster, higher quality decisions such as whether to grant margin loans. In telecommunication systems (and real-time adtech systems), revenue assurance requires the system to provide accurate real-time billing and charging on network data 10-100 times the scale of that which was required just a few years ago. We have found that the best way to handle the demanding workloads of these types of real-time decisioning use cases is to use a hybrid memory database platform that uniquely leverages DRAM with flash storage. This platform needs to smoothly scale out processing across multiple nodes and optimize the usage of CPUs, DRAM, SSDs and networks to efficiently scale up performance on a single node. Over the past six years, this technology has been continuously used in over a hundred successful production deployments, as many enterprises have discovered that it can substantially improve their business capabilities and enhance their users’ experience.",28,Science & Technology,PT30M28S,1828,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oy9jnajNJp8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,817,4,0,0,0

Though data safety issues have been addressed in traditional complex software systems such as aircraft engineering systems, ensuring data safety in distributed systems is a complex and arduous task. The complexity is due to necessity to ensure safety of various data such as configuration data, state changes at individual nodes, global state changes etc. Further, ensuring consistency of global state as well as the verification and validation of all the above data is required. We explore formal verification of the safety properties of distributed systems through recent work on IronFleet (http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/250-hawblitzel-online.pdf).

Taler avoids the the performance issues that plague Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus based solutions, and is developed entirely as free software, enabling groups outside the usual financial system to deploy online payments. These two features, along with Taler being developed entirely as free software, allow Taler to provide far cheaper transactions than the existing financial system, or block-chain based alternatives. In particular, Taler can realistically be deployed by groups outside the usual financial system. In this talk, Florian Dold gives a demonstration of Taler and a discussion of integrating the merchant software into existing websites.

Taler avoids the performance issues that plague Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus-based solutions and is developed entirely as free software, enabling groups outside the usual financial system to deploy online payments. These two features, along with Taler being developed entirely as free software, allow Taler to provide far cheaper transactions than the existing financial system or blockchain based alternatives. In particular, Taler can realistically be deployed by groups outside the usual financial system. Christian Grothoff is leading the Décentralisé research team at Inria, a French institute for applied computer science and mathematics research. He maintains GNUnet, an experimental network designed with the goal to provide privacy and security without the need for trusted third parties. He earned his PhD in computer science from UCLA, an M.S. in computer science from Purdue University, and a Diplom in mathematics from the University of Wuppertal.

In this talk, we’ll learn about: - A brief history of semantic CSS — a recap on the rise of CSS positioning, and the evolution of the “separation of style content.” - Today’s CSS conventions — a look on how we’re solving these issues today with the help of SMACSS, BEM, and RSCSS. - Thinking in modules — let’s explore the core methodology of modern - CSS: breaking apart interfaces into modular pieces. The future of modular CSS — an exploration of current and upcoming technology of how we’re pushing forward the ideas of modular CSS. https://metarefresh.talkfunnel.com/2016/16-the-modular-future-of-css",28,Science & Technology,PT49M18S,2958,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HsORdkQG658/maxresdefault.jpg,1,2134,40,3,0,3

For example, a computer with 4 cores can process over 16B tiles, and filter ~90k features and 2B tiles based on pre-defined conditions in ~10 minutes. TileReduce can be run on vector tilesets, which means that it can work on any data format(GeoJSON, osm files, shapefiles, and CSV and xml files having geo-data) that can be converted into a vector tileset. This talk will cover the JavaScript principles behind TileReduce, how parallelising works on TileReduce, the skeleton of a simple program written with TileReduce and showcase some ways in which you can use TileReduce in your projects.",28,Science & Technology,PT29M20S,1760,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KtUMS47TNNM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,252,7,0,0,0

Today, we can build reasonably accurate models for complex prediction problems such as detecting objects in Images, answering Jeopardy questions, translating documents from one language to another, or recognising people from face images. In this talk we will explore the next paradigm in data science - the “Reasoning Paradigm” that tries to optimize a “sequence of actions” leading from a “start state” to an “end state”. Prescribing a treatment plan for a set of symptoms, learning strategies for playing Chess or Go, solving multi-step problems in mathematics, maximizing life-time-value of a customer, having a goal driven conversation with a chat-bot, or connecting the dots on a knowledge graph are different flavours of multi-step reasoning problems that cannot be solved by the single-step prediction paradigm. This talk will focus on two specific reasoning paradigms - Mathematical Reasoning and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs. We will explore the building blocks for an intelligent reasoning engine that “explores” the space of possible solutions, “discovers” one or more solutions, characterizes the “quality” of each solution, “generalizes” to “similar” reasoning problems, and most importantly “learns” how to generate “better” solutions “faster” with practice - the holy grail of AI.

Model visualisation (model-vis) can help understand: the shape of the model, the impact of parameters & different input data on the model, the fit of the model & where it can be improved. Data science is a process of abstraction. In order to explain or to predict a real phenomena, the process start with framing the problem, acquiring & refining the data and then moves between the three layers of abstraction - transformations (data abstraction), visualisations (visual abstraction) and modelling (symbolic abstraction). All these three layers of abstraction work together to try and build a truer (or more closer) representation of the real phenomena. Data visualisation (data-vis) helps us to understand the portrait and the shape of the data. The science of data-vis for exploratory data analysis is well developed, for both static graphics (scatter plot matrices, glyph based approaches, geometric transforms like parallel coordinates) and interactive graphics (layering, brushing and linking, projections and tours). See my talk at Fifth Elephant 2015 on Visualising Multi Dimensional Data - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8rNDvPNg30. However, the power of visualisation is rarely leveraged for understanding the models developed better. Model evaluation is still largely restricted through numerical summaries. Extending visualisation to model building can be a powerful way to improve our understanding of the model. Model visualisation (model-vis) can help us to understand the shape of the model and compare it to the shape of the data. It allows to see the fit of the model and understand where the fit can be improved. It also allows us to better understand the parameters in the model and how the model changes when the parameters change as well as how the parameters changes when the input data changes. The science and tools for model-vis are still very under-developed. This talks looks at practical examples of doing model-vis in regression (linear, lasso), classification (logistic, trees, LDA) and clustering (hierarchical) problems that can help us better understand the model. This includes exploring model-vis approaches that: * Visualise the model in data space as opposed to data in model space * Visualise the entire space of models * Visualise the same model with varying tuning parameters * Visualise the same model with different input datasets * Visualise the process of model fitting as opposed to final result Integrating these approaches for model-vis as a part of model evaluation will strengthen the understanding of the model and lead to better model building for a data scientist. Model-vis can then complement data-vis for fitting better models as well as for communicating the insight from the data science process. Post this talk, the audience will have a better understanding of the power of visualisation beyond data-vis to model-vis and use it to build better models as a data scientist.

We work with the language of social, and this introduces a challenge of continuously adapting our models to the change in social verbiage. The language of social is dynamic with new hashtags, acronyms and induced spelling mistakes forcing us to update our models frequently. Moreover, the relevance or the noise is not same for every user (very similar to the idea of relevance in email inbox). So, we built a per-user statistical model to capture the preferences of users. It seems like its not a trivial problem to solve. This requires us to ensemble the global learning (remember the evolution in language) and local learning (basis on the feedback of the user) to classify the conversation. The local model must be able to capture the notion of concept drift i.e the temporal (and recent) change in data.

Bayesian methods permits one to construct statistical models by simultaneously using the current data and all the prior information on hand to make inference about the unknown nature of the underlying process, in a marvellously simple way. But the real reason for the popularity of Bayesian methods is the ability to solve real world data related problems by using the hierarchical structure and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An enormous number of problems that were deemed to be computational nightmares now cracked like open eggs by the rebirth of MCMC. We will show some examples to show the usefulness of MCMC and how much cautious the experimenter should be before expecting MAGIC! 1. The talk begins by stating a research problem in ecology. The characteristics of the problem will be explained with the types of inferences we are interested in. I will also show the unavailability of any closed form solutions for them. 2. This will be followed by a brief introduction to Bayesian methods of analysis and by Bayesian approach of learning from data. I will explain how hierarchical structure helps in modelling data. Next will be a description of a generic set of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms that is frequently used to fit the hierarchical models. 3. Then I will go back to the problem described at the beginning of the talk and use hierarchical Bayesian approach with MCMC to solve it. I will explain usefulness and some drawbacks of MCMC under Bayesian approach. The talk will end after a discussion on generality and robustness of Bayesian paradigm.

When we focus on the aspect of “gaining knowledge” or “learning”, few other approaches have done better than rigorous application of scientific methods. As we all know too well, the scientific method involves careful observation, construction of relevant theories and confronting these theories with data. In the context of understanding the world of big cats in the wild, the scientific method demands investigators to pose well-defined questions, spend vast amounts of time in the field carefully gathering field data and then spending time behind computers analyzing them before drawing conclusions. Hence there is a vast amount of human learning in the process. So how do tools such as machine learning, parallel and high performance computing contribute to such a seemingly earthy field of wildlife ecology and conservation? In this talk, focusing on some of my recent ecological research work on tigers, lions and cheetahs, and quantitative methods, I will describe what it takes to make computing approaches (ML, PC and HPC) highly relevant to the field of ecology. I argue, with a potpourri of demonstrable examples, that such computational “tools” are extremely useful only when considered within a broader scientific study and a failure to do so may lead us into spurious conclusions that may prove costly!

This talk will describe the massive access to credit problem in India, (or why fin-tech is the hottest kid on the block today), and open the audience’s minds up to using their ML knowledge towards this cause which is improving how people live their lives everyday. We can enable them a better quality of life, all while appreciating their unique differences to personalise the risk-assessment and risk-pricing, and still being able to scale up the technology using ML. “Small tenure, small ticket-size” loans is a genre which cannot be solved by traditional ways of risk-assessment in banking. The cost of sourcing, analysing, approving and servicing is way too high for a request for a Rs. 60,000 laptop. And if that request is from a student, it will be rejected outright due to no income and no credit history. So the entire process has to be re-thought end-to-end from first-principles to be non-traditional and technology-first. Technology has to deeply disrupt every stage, so that disbursing loans at scale for such small amounts becomes viable. As the former Economic Advisor to the Government of India C. Rangarajan recently said, “There are two aspects to financial inclusion: one is bank accounts and the second is access to credit. The scheme announced by the prime minister addresses the first problem. The issue of making credit available to small borrowers remains.” ML in fin-tech is helping bring Financial Inclusion in India at the biggest scale seen in history so far. Character evaluation and risk-assessment still remain extremely complex areas as they are about evaluating how people might behave. There is plenty of behavioral psychology to take advantage of as well. We capture 20,000+ data points during the application process, and use those to varying degrees in the evaluation. ### Speaker bio * I studied BS and MS at Stanford University in Computer Science, built GraphSearch with the creator of Google Maps Lars while working as a Facebook engineer, was a VC associate at MDV ($700M fund) post that, and the youngest PM at Microsoft HoloLens post that, among other experiences. My two specialisations at Stanford were Systems and AI. I also enjoy behavioral psychology and we’re employing it in our product, design, and risk-assessment algorithms. * I am co-leading the largest consumer-lending fin-tech company in India: * Fin-tech in India is a trillion$ market because of India’s size. Today we have 25 crore people online and in the next 5 years that number is poised to grow to around 70-80 crore. This kind of a relative and absolute growth will not be witnessed again in the world * India has ~53% of its population under 25 years of age. It is a country of millennials, for whom, banking and lending have to be re-imagined. * India is mobile-first. * Finomena, the company I co-lead, is bringing Financial Inclusion to a country of 1.25 Billion people through focusing on the holy-grail of “small tenure, small ticket size” lending which can only be done in a tech-first way to be effective. * Finomena is built on the foundation provided by Aadhaar (the world’s largest biometric fingerprint and identity platform of it’s kind with 1 Billion people already registered on it). The Aadhaar platform will be as revolutionary over the next 5 years as the smartphone platform was from 2010-2015 in India. * I am a contributor to the “India-Stack” discussions - this refers to the most advanced fin-tech infrastructure in the world being developed by the Indian govt and several leading private sector thought-leaders in India * India is it’s own beast (because of it’s scale, diversity and chaos), and requires it’s own innovations, and I am in the rare position to compare and contrast the happenings in India with those in US (because I spent 7 years there) and/or China today.

For example, a classifier built to discriminate between “books” with positive, negative and neutral reviews when applied to discriminate between “kitchen products” into the same set categories, its performance drops. This relates to one of the fundamental probably approximately correct (PAC) assumptions that the training and test samples come from the same distribution. Consequently it leads to the practical implication that supervised models need to be provided with (enough number of) training samples from the domain where it is expected to be applied. This leads to laborious, tedious and ongoing labeling exercise limiting scalability and fast deployment of supervised algorithms. In real life analytics applications, building models from scratch for every new domain hinders large-scale adoption of supervised statistical learning based analytics applications. Transfer learning techniques allow domains, tasks, and distributions used in training and testing to be different, thus reducing the requirement for labelled data.

E-commerce is booming across the globe at an astonishing rate. India alone is expected to witness CAGR of 50% by 2020. In such a fast-faced and mobile-first market, online commerce experiences (e.g., intent identification, search results, product recommendations) are steadily replacing deep discounts as the means to acquire and retain consumers. While consumers interact with buyer-side portals, the organization of products (aka catalogues) acquired through seller-side platforms plays pivotal role towards search, discovery and personalization experiences. Unfortunately, different sellers have different interpretations of the same product and distributed onboarding of products produces poorly organized e-commerce catalogues. For instance, a large fraction of products in such catalogues have inconsistency between product title and product image, missing product titles or keywords, incorrect tagging of keywords and several duplicate products. This further results in poor and irrelevant search, personalization and recommendations; degrading user experience significantly. With the use of SKUs, normalizing and cleaning of products has been possible for products in consumer electronics space. However, due to poorly organized catalogues and inherent difficulties in describing and quantifying product details, the problem of organizing products as SKUs in categories such as fashion (e.g., fashion apparel, fashion accessories) and lifestyle (such as home-decor) has been largely unsolved. The problem becomes even more critical if one has to build an aggregate fashion commerce application that ingests several such poorly tagged catalogues. In this talk, I will describe how deep learning has made it possible to prepare SKUs for fashion and lifestyle products. We innovate and apply deep image parsing to extract detailed product information from product images. We further apply deep learning models originally conceived for images to process text paragraphs to solve Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation to produce structured outputs. Using confidence scores of the two process, we then combine results of text and image parsing to merge and create unique products.

Your bot needs to understand ambiguous natural language inputs, guess user’s intent and context, extract relevant entities, lookup catalogs, generate responses to elicit more information, build user’s profile and finally create and fulfill orders!! While deep learning cannot create an end-to-end assistant for you automatically, it can certainly help with several of the tasks above. In this talk, I’ll discuss how deep learning can be used for natural language understanding, in particular, to solve the problem of slot-filling. For instance, from the sentence ‘recharge 9900990099 for Rs 100’, we can fill up two slots needed by our recharge bot: phone_number = 9900990099, recharge_amount = 100. Slot-filling is an instance of the more complex semantic parsing problem. While the latter requires building sophisticated parse trees, slot-filling is, in essence, is a sentence labeling problem. Historically, methods based on conditional random fields (CRFs) have been used to solve the slot-filling problem. Not surprisingly, deep learning methods now outperform CRFs for sequence labeling tasks also. I will present multiple recurrent neural network (RNN) variations for the sequence labeling problem and discuss their relative advantages.

While a naive search bar that simplified information extraction and delivery of web pages was the rage in early 2000s, exponential increase in data and information on the Internet is making it natural for the search bar to evolve into a smarter and responsive interface. Not only can this search bar be more responsive in terms of guiding users in an iterative aka conversation based search, but it can also be assistive in fetching information that suits the interests of different users. Sooner or later, such conversational interfac will replace the old-generation search bar. However, building such conversational interface has several technology challenges: a) the interface has to understand and extract intent from natural human inputs in terms of text or speech (this is partly done by the current generation search interfaces), b) it has to generate meaningful dialogue responses to engage users into a conversation, c) it has to understand and use context to assist users in fetching the most relevant information, and while doing so d) make the information results personalized to the user as she uses the interface over time. How do we solve these technology challenges? Where are we in terms of building systems and solutions to tackle them? Is the ‘conversational search’ a hype or soon to be reality? How are recent advances in deep learning playing their role towards building such ‘chat bots’? In this talk, I will take a deep dive to answer these questions and present the state of the art in building conversational agents using deep learning. Specifically, I will talk about advances in deep text mining that make it possible to extract intent from text: text segmentation or sequence labeling to extract entities from a sentence or paragraph. I will also talk about, how can one build a dialogue generation system (especially in the absence of a large corpus of dialogues) using information on the web. I will then give an example of a chat bot that uses context in a conversation to recommend apparels and fashion products to consumers, and assists them to arrive at the product that they would like to buy in no time. Overall, the talk will give an overview of the current state of deep learning techniques to build a chat bot, and provide details a few techniques such as LSTM or sequence to sequence learning in bulding a chat bot in reality.",28,Science & Technology,PT30M36S,1836,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kwzbbym2G2w/maxresdefault.jpg,1,1780,22,2,0,0

However, the mechanics of the meditation technique are rarely dissected. Books, articles, and presentations -- particularly from modern neuroscience -- usually focus on long term outcomes of meditation practice or high-level abstractions for describing human consciousness. In this talk, Steven attempts to create relatable contexts and analogues to describe these mechanics with the objective of making the material accessible, even for those who have never tried meditating before. The target audience is the broad categories of ""hackers"": anyone who loves to satisfy their curiosity by taking things apart, applying active skepticism to processes, and trying things for themselves.

Realm is not an ORM on top of SQLite. Instead it uses its own persistence engine, built for simplicity & speed. A true cross platform solution that replaces sqllite and core data on android and iOS. Most android apps requires a persistance storage to provide caching and offline functionalities in the app. Currently there are very limited options avialble for persitance storage, most people rely on SQLite or file storage. If app’s backend is no sql there is an additional overhead of conversion with SQLite. SQLites api’s on android are complicated, most people in turn uses additional ORM layer on the top adding additional complexity. In this talk we will be talking about Realm, how to use it in your app, perfomrance comparison for read, write, updates. Some pros and cons of using Realm vs sqllite. We will also be comparing realm agains CouchDB Lite another no SQL database for mobile from CouchDB team.

The tablets run an app, which are deployed across various clinics across the US, delivers educational content for patients. Both the content for the app and the app itself needed to be managed remotely from a central location. The MDM solution needed to be very reliable with a very high uptime for the tablets. The major learnings that I want to cover are: How we automated the setup of Android tablets to be deployed to the field by creating a Custom ROM.

This is a classic “inverted test pyramid”. While most of the people know about this inverted test pyramid, there are challenges in writing tests at the unit level for Android apps because of the platforms’ architecture. We too struggled with the right approach to test our application initially. We eventually figured out an approach by experimenting with different design patterns like MVP (Model-View-Presenter), MVVM and different testing frameworks like JUnit, Roboelectric, Espresso, Calabash. In this talk, we will talk about our journey to achieve the ideal test pyramid structure. We will discuss the challenges we faced to test our apps and the approaches to overcome them with a working example. At the end of the session, we will understand how to structure the code appropriately to unit test the logic and add tests at the appropriate layer. Presentation Outline: 1) We will showcase a working Android application which will have features around components like database, network call and heavy UI like viewpager, etc. We will explain the importance of writing tests and test pyramid to maintain the stability of the project if we need to scale this application where more developers will be churning code. 2) We will look at listing the test scenarios of the application and discuss the levels these tests could be written in colloration with the inputs from the audience. 3) We will discuss the disadvantages of having so many tests at the functional level. 4) We will discuss the challenges we faced in our project because unit testing in Android does not come naturally and how we ended up with inverted test pyramid. 5) We will talk about our journey of trying different design patterns like MVP and MVVM. 6) We will build the same application by following TDD and will come up with a pattern which is a mixture of MVP and MVVM. We will test drive the functionalities and will showcase how to write tests at each layer of test pyramid on Android by using test frameworks like Junit and Espresso. https://droidconin.talkfunnel.com/2015/55-where-do-the-android-tests-belong",28,Science & Technology,PT44M54S,2694,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0NPWkhXnOK4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,284,3,0,0,0

That is, I quit my job and made a bet that I could somehow make a living by organising community events encouraging people to use open source, something I had been doing for the past decade while earning nothing from it. In the four plus years since, I ended up running two experiments without realising it. In the first, I had a vision for how things should work, so I built towards that vision. I wanted the community to adopt the open web and open source, so I organised conferences around those topics. I wanted peer review to ensure a high quality of content, so I built peer review tools and processes. The conferences were entirely top down. I had a vision for how they should work, and that's how they were built. In the second, I kept getting requests for help with a certain problem, but I wasn't interested in it, so to tell people to stop bothering me, I built a website where they could talk to each other without involving me. I didn't want to be bothered for support, so I didn't put any contact information on the site. There was almost no way to tell who had built it or how to contact me. Everything about the site was to tell people to help each other as they saw fit, I had no interest in their problems. The first experiment was HasGeek, which I'm happy to say has succeeded in paying salaries for a team of ten. Before we attempted this, nobody thought it was possible, so my top-down approach to it has been working. The second I did not even bother to give it a proper name. I called it ""Has job"" as a joke, then added ""HasGeek Job Board"" to clarify in case someone didn't understand. Hasjob doesn't earn anything for HasGeek, but has been so successful people think HasGeek is a job board company that for some reason organises events. People have trouble believing that nobody in HasGeek works on Hasjob day-to-day, the site just runs itself. In 2013 we started having a spam problem with HR agencies harassing employers, so to get people to stop complaining, we started hiding contact information and requiring a user account to apply for a job. When we checked again in 2014, we had over thirty thousand user accounts! Hasjob was actually bigger than HasGeek now! And yet nobody in HasGeek (except me) knew anything about how Hasjob worked. In 2015, I sat down to understand what had happened. How come a site we built to tell people to go away was doing better than something we did full time? The answer is that it was a bottom-up approach, while organising events was top-down. Bottom-up gets you great return for minimal effort, but the community goes where it wants to. Top-down gives you control, but it's a lot of work to push the community in the direction you want to go.

Contrary to product claims, it is hard to find a single data store that meets common read-write patterns of on-line applications. Different databases try to optimize for specific workload patterns and data durability, consistency guarantees - use Memory buffer pools, Write-ahead logs, optimize for Flash storage etc. These data stores are not operated in isolation and need to share data and updates on it - for e.g. a high performance memory based KV data cache might need to be updated when data in the source-of-truth RDBMS or Columnar database changes.

After having experienced a few server side scalability bottlenecks due to inefficient Unicorn workers, we decided to port some of the feasible and critical code to Elixir which exploits the soft real-time capabilities of the Erlang VM. In a Service Oriented Architecture centric environment, various Ruby APIs doing IO on network fitted a great use case for the Erlang VM. 2. CouchDB is another software written in Erlang. It plays a significant role in storage of custom JSON data and enable real-time streaming search through CouchDB Views. We injected a Elixir evaluation runtime in CouchDB to allow us to write views in Elixir, which results in performant View generation times while also assuring developer productivity. 3. RabbitMQ has been a critical component for our backend infrastructure . The use of topic exchanges can enable the source logic and the consumer logic to be decoupled enabling us to write generic publishers which could just be embedded as a library in other services. Finally I shed some light upon production issues that can occur in Erlang VM and the ways to fix them.",28,Science & Technology,PT16M24S,984,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u-xI4jOfng4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,923,13,0,0,0

Yet, almost every monitoring system today completely ignores this key distinction and floods us with thousands of mechanical streams of data-points that are increasingly a burden for an operator to interpret and react on. They often do not account for vital data about the operational response which is absolutely key to how infrastructure is run in any enterprise. The perception of time is central to this concept, clustering diverse data-points we build an abstract construct that closely mimics how humans perceive and react to events and situations. While raw data-streams are modeled as low dimension immutable facts that systems can rapidly and effectively interpret, this abstraction is mutable and modeled as an FSM (finite state machine), enabling it to hold several derived dimensions that are of great value. These attributes/dimensions can be attained through transformation functions triggered by the event stream. This abstraction has had a profound impact on how we at Directi interact with our issues and infrastructure and enables us to explore possibilities that didn’t exist before . We shall take a sneak peak of the λ-architecture and Materialized Views in Slant (our platform) that abstracts the standard monitoring layer into a mesh of highly composable and flexible constructs. This has empowered us to ask and answer complex questions such as - How do I define the virality/relative score of an issue? How did the operations team respond? What caused my team to lose sleep and how they reacted & resolved these issues ? What deployment, support & policy changes impacted operations and how ? How do I deduce optimal alerts and escalations ? What issues are critical and what was the root cause ? Finally we shall then look at real world examples such as the ability to identify hot points,overlay diverse but related data, define auto aggregations in a more natural form, doing away with trigger level redundancy. How this enables conversation and allows us to organically explore issues and get a top level unified real-time and historical view of issues in our infrastructure and visualize them. Dhananjay Sathe is a former BITS Pilani grad currently working as a Sr Operations Engineer on the Platform Team at Directi/Endurance where he architects and builds the central operations platform and toolchain. In the past he has contributed OpenSource Projects such as Samba through the GSoC, Gnome and been one of the developers behind the RoboEarth Cloud Engine.

We take the key contribution of Facebook’s React framework - the idea of Virtual DOM and DOM Reconciliation and push it as far as it can seemingly go. In no small part does Facebook’s React framework owe its popularity to its magical ease – it provides a declarative way of describing UIs, and blazing fast performance for free. Good performance in this programming model is feasible because of a key design tenet of React called DOM Reconciliation. In short, React does not mutate or create the actual DOM (for that is expensive and full of peril), instead it creates a representation of the DOM (which is called the Virtual DOM) at every app state, and then applies only the differences that need to be applied to the actual DOM. In this talk, we will explore what designing and programming UIs with such a Virtual DOM representation entails. We extend the Virtual DOM idea to the server-side and represent complex UIs as denotations tied to their Web Component counterparts. This combination makes it easy to compose data-driven UIs from smaller reusable parts. We will also see examples of these ideas manifesting in the Elm ecosystem and some Julia UI packages (namely Interact, Patchwork, and Canvas)",28,Science & Technology,PT17M45S,1065,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPL0e_xgZwg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,139,1,0,0,0

It has three layers - batch, serving and speed: The batch layer is responsible for computing arbitrary views on the master data. Our master data is an immutable store in HDFS and we compute views using a series of Map Reduce jobs using Scalding and Spark. Our batch system runs recomputation every day on our entire data set. The serving layer indexes and exposes precomputed views to be queried ad-hoc with low latency. We use HBase, Solr and our own inhouse inmemory implementation for the serving layer. The speed layer deals only with new data and compensates for the high latency updates of the serving layer by creating realtime views. Our real time latency requirements are in few hours and not in seconds, which allows us to use a micro-batch architecture that is a stripped down version of our batch layer and uses the same technologies. To get the final result, the batch and realtime views must be queried and the results merged together. In this talk, the speaker explains the following: Why Lambda Architecture? What problems did it solve for us?

As the browsers continue to evolve and become more powerful, the application architectures tend to move more towards the client than the server, enabling the browser to do most of the heavy lifting, while providing a seamless experience to the users. However, as the applications grow, so does their memory footprint. It becomes very essential to understand the internals of javascript garbage collector in order to write memory efficient code. Also, it is possible to look at the different parts of javascript memory usage like DOM nodes and events. We'll be taking a look at some of the real applications and analyzing them for memory leaks.

Disappointed by the available options, I decided to write my own - we now have an elegant, usable system that continues working even if completely offline, but also provides us with real-time stock & revenue reports via Google Spreadsheets when online.

The unorthodox architecture of our distributed (multi-outlet-ready), offline-enabled system that syncs with Google Spreadsheets. We get real-time insight into exactly how many cupcakes we've sold at individual store-levels. We use web-services built with Google Script (Javascript) and Google Docs' own permission model to manage our data in the cloud. 3. Operational deployment & future possibilities. Our deployment process is very simple - the main POS is a self-contained, local HTML file that gets synced through Google Drive.

The journey will outline: 1. Why we planned to build this entirely using AngularJS? 2. The process of building this App, right from UX requirements to actual launch 3. Real examples of the problems we faced and what we had to unlearn in this process 4. How we started to enjoy and embrace the AngularJS framework? We will touch upon the following concepts of AngularJS that helped us tackle the various roadblocks encountered - Building routes for apps with multi-level navigation - Managing Complex UI states - Chaining the Flow using deferred objects - Use cases of Events and Directives - Cases in which we changed Angular's default behaviour to get the UX we wanted 5.

We'll cover how developers (in small companies or huge corporations - doesn't matter) neglect various portions of the population, thereby going against the very philosophy of the Web. We'll have case studies of how even the biggest of companies have screwed up in the past, and what you can do to not repeat those mistakes. In each case study, we'll also cover what the company should have done and how it could have ended up being beneficial for everyone involved. We'll cover why browser sniffing is evil (and the small exceptions when they might be okay), the correct ways to do feature detection, testing on various platforms (and how to make it as easy as possible), semantics and why they are usefull, and above all else - the philosophy of the Web...

Consider this common scenario: You're designing a product and you need some input from the user. The journey date for a travel booking website, perhaps. You might arrive at a solution by considering: common date entry techniques on the web (HTML date input, Javascript date pickers etc.), factors that have a strong correlation with the project's context (e.g. range of valid dates for bookings) and any constrains imposed by the environment (e.g. device capabilities). An alternate, bottom-up approach might be to reason out a solution on the basis of beliefs such as: every point of input slows the interface; can we avoid an explicit decision from the user? Be liberal while accepting inputs; are we too strict? Simple trumps complex; can we use a native select dropdown instead of a Javascript date picker? With this talk, I hope to show how we can use such philosophies as a foundation for bottom-up decision making -- a foundation that spans across projects and addresses design's uncertainty head-on. And finally, to show how this foundation can evolve organically and encourage progress. I have been building web stuff for the last seven years and like most peers in this field, I am largely self-taught.

Today, with the advent of frontend javascript frameworks for the web and native platforms for the mobile, the servers have become just API servers ; which is great. The downside; every web/mobile app, now has an API. Many of them are poorly designed. Consuming even a well designed API takes a lot of developer's time. Most of them quit right after they see the documentation. What can we do to make our API's easily consumable and help us build a developer community? Building a REST based API is not enough any more. Consumption of an API must be abstracted the to a click of a button or a few lines of code. I want to share the techniques we used while 1. designing an API for SupportBee which is a single page application (using backbone) 2. building a hosted app platform on the designed API We will have look at services like Zapier and IFTTT which are abstracting consumption of API's all over the web. I have been working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for the last 3 years. I am the backend hacker at SupportBee since its blueprint days. I have been a part of designing its API from the scratch and its evolution into a app platform.",28,Science & Technology,PT38M52S,2332,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V3rQWpnykyY/maxresdefault.jpg,,201,0,0,0,0

There is a fundamental problem with HTML and JavaScript that makes it hard to build reusable components / widgets - The DOM contents of the component is not encapsulated from the rest of the page. This could possibly lead to collision of IDs; unexpected JavaScript behaviour because of some existing code; broken styles; and so on. Today we overcome most of these problems by following certain conventions and assumptions. ""Web Components"" is a set of cutting-edge standards to solve these problems. I will be covering some of the key aspects of building re-usable components: - Templates - Style Encapsulation - Separation of contents from the presentation - Different players of Web components - Templates, Shadow DOM, Observers, etc. My name is Varunkumar Nagarajan.

MetaRefresh is an interesting conference. Among all the hasgeek conferences this is the one where you see an overlap between the left- brained and the right-brained. On one hand you meet amazing designers who are creating art and on the other you have front-end engineers who run routes and scripts around all of us. My session is about the place where these two meet. The session is about why frontend engineers need to understand and embrace the simplicity of the protocol they are building upon. Designers need to get that the intrinsic value of the world wide web is when non-technical folks (like my parents) are able to buy tickets, shop for stuff, play games on FB without worrying about their money getting stolen, malware eating their photos and losing their cat pictures. I used to freelance as a Web Application Security Consultant. Now I run my Application Security Company with special focus on Web and Mobile.

Design, esp. on the web, is not just pixel perfection. It is perhaps as important, if not more, to deliver a friendly and coherent experience from the very first point of interaction. Behind the scenes every product is driven by a complex system, the internals of which — be it technology, implementation or business speak — are far from comforting for users. However, often as designers or as product/business owners, we overlook such elements that trickle through our products and expose themselves leading to a disconcerting experience. We'll take a look at some examples where details are unnecessarily exposed (e.g. revealing file extensions in URLs) and why creators and designers of systems should try utmost to identify them and make them invisible in their products.

As product creators - designers & developers alike - we do our best to keep up to date about the newest of technologies. We are inspired by the possibilites they present and motivated to learn and master them. We put these technologies to use, to build the products we envision. This excites us, and addiction is easy. We lead ourselves down a path of obsession in a quest to master the tools. Absolute know-how becomes the goal. And we lose sight of what we set out to achieve. Our minds get occupied with figuring out ""how"" to build our products, and this distracts us from keeping in mind ""why"" we set out to build them in the first place. Although the ""how"" is of utmost significance, it is important to think of your product from a holistic perspective. It's easy to get lost in achieving technical wins, but it's equally important to think about why those are necessary. The question, ""why"", is a very important and significant one. It helps us to level with ourselves and bring ourselves out of the obsession with technology. ""Why"", reminds us that the tools are just a means to accomplish something more meaningful. I'll be talking for the ""why"". I constantly think about the design process - as I was never educated in one. I studied to be an engineer but educated to become a product designer. I'm still educating myself with the help of others - and try to do my bit helping others however I can. I now live in Singapore and work with different companies to create products.

The rapid digitization of the blueprints for creative projects have greatly lowered the barrier to getting started. These new tools and practices have greatly influenced the workflows that artists, designers, and technologists operate with, and have upended traditional notions of authorship and copyright.

Programming languages are no exception to this rule. This is why JavaScript, an unassuming browser scripting language has experienced such a meteoric rise, overcoming its technical shortcomings and slow, buggy browser implementations. JavaScript struggled to shed its initial casting as a mere scripting language. It was not considered a serious language until the advent of AJAX, where, to most people's surprise, it proved to be very appropriate, even replacing the X of XML with its own JSON. When a technology performs well for new use cases, it is a proof of its technical merits.
