We have seen how to set the value of k in KNN and how to run the KNN algorithm on entire data set as well as train and test dataset. K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN for short, is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms. KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. KNN Being a lazy learning algorithm implies that there is little to no training phase. Therefore, we can immediately classify new data points as they present themselves.

This data set has prices of house along with the factors that has an impact on the house price. We looked at the relationship between price and many other variables and then looked at the distribution of data using histogram. Also we took a look at log transformation to understand the distribution of data which is usually not apparent with the actual data values. We also looked briefly on how you can treat missing values in a data set. We have used library like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, statsmodels, seaborn etc. to help understand the data exploration, cleaning and visualization.

Data science term started sometime around 2001 when William S. Cleveland written a paper about Data Science but this is not made it popular. It took almost around 8 to 10 years to really see the data science in action. Data science success is hugely depend on the advancement in big data storing and processing which enabled the programmers to apply the algorithms on that and make prediction. It is said that Mike Loukides Who in 2010 worked as the vice president of Content strategy for O’Reilly Media, helped bringing data science in mainstream. Also Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil article about Data Science : The Sexiest Job of 21st Century, really helped getting the attention of organizations and individuals. And today every organization whether public or private, adopting big data and data science as their most important process to predict the future and make better decision. Also in this video you’ll find the process of data science which at a high level, followed in every company and I also talked about the various data science teams job titles that are required to make a fully functional great data science teams.

Machine learning is a buzz word today where every company or every other person is talking about and want to go in this field. Whether a fresher or an experienced person or MBA etc. they all want to go in the field of machine learning because it is one of the highest paying job. But before going in the machine learning, you need to understand what is machine learning, how it has gain the popularity in last couple of years and companies that have contributed in the success of machine learning. So machine learning is a set of programs / algorithms that basically takes a huge data to understand the patterns, behavior and trend from this data and then make a prediction. In the traditional systems or machines we used to provide only data and set of rules to process the data but in machine learning we provide not only the data but also the answers that we expect machine learn and then tell us whenever the same situation is arising in future. This helps to reduce the burden on mind to remember each and every transaction and analyze them and learn what each and then group of transactions are saying. And we are then talking the help of machines to basically learn all of this knowledge from data and help us making the better and informed decision on a day to day basis. Machine learning algorithms like neural networks, logistics etc. where developed in 19th century but because there was not much processing power was available; they could not really use the algorithm at its full potential. With the advancement in the storing and processing the big data, company started using the machine learning because now have they all the power to story and analyze the millions and billions of rows in couple of seconds and then apply the machine learning algorithm on it to understand what each row is saying. With this advancement now almost every other company is adopting the big data and machine learning to process and analyze the huge datasets that they have and take the knowledge out for better future prediction.

In this python machine learning video I have talked about how you can achieve the ordinary least square linear regression using python statmodels package. We review what the main goals of regression models are, see how the linear regression models tie to the concept of linear equations, and learn to interpret the coefficients of a simple linear regression model with an example. This is the first video in what will be, or is (depending on when you are watching this) a multipart video series about Simple Linear Regression. In the next few minutes we will cover the basics of Simple Linear Regression starting at square one. And for the record, from now on if I say ""regression"" I am referring to simple linear regression as opposed to multiple regression or models that are not linear. Regression allows us to model, mathematically, the relationship between two or more variables. For now, we will be working with just two variables; an independent variable and a dependent variable. The truth is, when we talk about how ""good"" a regression model is we are actually comparing it to another specific model. Oftentimes, students do not realize this. So in this video, we are going to talk about that idea. I will also begin introducing basic terminology and concepts that will carry you through your work using regression.
